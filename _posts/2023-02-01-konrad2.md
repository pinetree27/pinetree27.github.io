<img src="/assets/blog_posts/posts/jansson1.png" alt="A Youtube screnshot of a documentary with Tove Jansson, “Mumin och Havet”, from 1968. She has blonde hair up to her ears in a wavy bob, she’s looking away from the camera with a big smile, as if she just found out something out, a secret, and she can’t wait to tell you. The English subtitles read: ‘oh yes, I’m gonna tell you what it was like!’." width="100%" height="100%">
