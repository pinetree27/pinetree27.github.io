<p><i><span class="more_info" title="You never told me about Troll in the Wings.">Du berätta aldrig om troll i kulisserna för mig. </span> I found out about it last year, in one of those August afternoons I spent lazily browsing on my computer while you worked in the other room. The play, the second official Mumin theatre adaptation written by Tove Jansson and directed by Vivica Bandler, is known today mostly because of its beginning, in which the Mumin actors enter the stage with usual, intact costumes to then remove their fluffy heads – unmasking, amongst others, the perfectly childish smirk of Lasse Pöysti, playing Moomintrollet. This was ostensibly done to give the actors more freedom with voice and facial expressions, but a dark-internet myth has gathered around the play: children in the audience terrorized by this quasi Mumin decapitation, revealing horribly out-of-place humans inside their white, rotund bodies. With the following performances and the TV broadcast the incident was repeated, making the play into a uniting traumatic memory for generations of Swedish children.</i></p>

<P> When I started writing this in May, I wanted to talk about childhood – mine and yours, or rather, the projection of mine on yours, because you don’t like talking about the past and I try to respect that. In the following months, with the following rewrites, I set out to find more information on this play. I was hoping to see the taking-off of the masks – to hear, if not see, the children’s reaction – but I haven’t been able to find any clips of it. In the (unofficial) Mumin wiki, which my research history states I consulted, this ‘decapitation’ is mentioned without any horrific undernotes. Were children really scared? Where did I get the idea that they were? While the absence of proof solidifies the status of the event as a myth, there must’ve been another source, expanding on the story to prove, once more, the Internet’s strange passion for finding the grotesque, the uncanny, the not-quite-right, the traumatising in children’s stories. And that I hadn’t just invented it. </P>

<P> You have, of course, no memory of Troll I kulisserna. You were born too late; the Mumin stories you grew up with were different, safe, an uncomplicated background: there, but never essential. <span class="more_info" title="But were there other stories of horror that captured you, when you were young?">Med fanns det någon annan marginell skräck från sagor som fängslade dig när du var liten?</span> You became uneasy when, during one of my marathons, I showed you the ’70 Mumin episode in which Mårran appears for the first time. After asking me to press stop, you told me of how deeply unsettling it was, as a child, to see her towering over Sniff; mysterious, cold, silent. A creature one couldn’t make sense of, couldn’t speak to. Did you have to distinguish, then,  between what your eyes just saw and the child’s memory, enlarged, made stranger against the backdrop of your mind?</P>

<P> Whether I came up with it or someone else, the question is: what feelings, fake or real, were activated and subsumed into the memory of the Mumin beheading as it was passed on, shared, confused, installed in the precarious architecture of recollection - which <span class="more_info" title="pleasures and terrors">«njutningar och fasor»</span>, otherwise unspeakable, found their expression in it?</P>

I was gifted the complete edition <span class="more_info" title="in translation">(iöversatt)</span> of the original Tove Jansson Mumin strips for my eighteenth birthday, long before I met you. I was a little into them, mostly fascinated by Snufkin, but it was the gift of a friend trying to share her passion for them with me. When I told you, did you feel that I was being ungenuine, maybe inventing, doing too much - or that I was trying to steal from the cultural depository of your childhood? Is this how you felt about the latest 3D animated series, made for an international audience with puzzling British accents, that also moved me?

Or did you just not care - had it been that long?

<span class="more_info" title="But you gifted me a Snufkin cup for my birthday last year.">Ändå gav du mig en Snusmumriken-kopp i födelsedagspresent förra året. Were you letting me in on the secret, your childhood, the one thing we cannot share, no matter how much I’d like to - were you welcoming me into it or just indulging me and my childish desires?

<span class="more_info" title="I don’t remember my childhood and that’s one of the few things I can say with certainty about it.">Jag minns inte mycket från min barndom, och det är en av få saker for mjag kan säga med säkerhet. Another one: you weren’t there. But then again, I wasn’t either. And not just in the sense that I, the person I’ve come to be, do not and cannot live there anymore - the basic fact that the membrane of childhood doesn’t allow trespassing: «my infancy is long dead and I am alive»[^1]; but because I barely lived in that house, consumed by the business of survival, which makes ghosts of us all. My memory, the second house, made into a broken sieve, unfit for my purposes, the tasks of life.
