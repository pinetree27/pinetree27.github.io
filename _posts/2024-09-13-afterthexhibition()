  <p>AFTER THE EXHIBITION</p> 
<p>What came back to me after reading his story out loud, overwhelmed with emotion:</p>
<p>•	I think that writing is constantly failing at what you love.</p>
<p>•	The magic of us, what we can do together.</p>
<p>•	Flashbacks of Prague in February, being alone but knowing that there was someone waiting for me. The last months before leaving home, all of its beauty and horror, the terrifying unending hours of preparation, the time carved away for my friends. The last week; singing with Ivan at the night, the hours at the bars which advanced slowly. The month I lived with Bea and I felt the pull to stay, to move a little closer. Beginning of October, when my brother came to visit in my student dorm and we walked alongside the same life for a little while again. The morning I arrived in Paris, tired and confused, and Saou picked me up from the station and put together a huge breakfast that went on for hours. The sunlit evenings of the first lockdown, when I forced myself to write every night and something came out of that, too, even if it didn’t have to.</p>
<p>•	The night me and Coco rejoiced over learning that we had used the same word to describe the particular electricity of the exhibition, magic. It’s not an uncommon word, maybe not one a writer should use proudly. But that evening I was drunk and sentimental and I have to protect that, too: the feeling of wonder of both of us having carved the same word to describe that same feeling. While the conversation went on, I browsed my phone and then showed Coco the first draft of this, the word ‘magic’ right at its beginning, as evidence, as proof.</p>
<p>•	I’ve been thinking a lot about memory, my hometowns. In my first year in Berlin it was the sea that lapped my thoughts most frequently. It was the first element of my life in Italy I tried to turn into symbol, folding layers of meaning on top of each other: pictures, lines from poems, the words of friends, too, born by the sea, to make a figure of my own. All along the sea was there, unchanged, and the after-image of me and my brother staring out into it before he left. Me, wondering when meaning would kick into place, fill the experience. Now that my heart is bound to others which bind me to Berlin, I’ve started remembering the narrow, internal streets of Pozzuoli, the ample ones of Naples, opening (with a sudden gasp) into a sudden sky, the sea. What does missing mean? It’s just the heart adjusting. During my first year, I lied to my heart and let it reminisce, because the jump had been hard. Half here, half there. Promising to come back, to myself, to others - until it didn’t matter anymore. </p>
<p>•	I’ve weaved my heart in with yours. How long for doesn’t matter. Ribbons from yours are interlaced with mine. Traces: I hope you feel the same. </p>
<p>•	Something in my heart shifted, like an old cosmic mechanism commanding the eclipses and the seasons of the moon, as I read the last words of Tommaso. I knew then that, for all my rush, my imprecisions, my shortcomings, the slips of my pen and my accent, the ritual had been successful. I knew then, as certainly as I know that it is me who was speaking, that Tommaso is alive, that we did it, me and him.</p>
<p>•	One day the sum of the exhibition will rise again over me and I will remember.</p>
<p>•	That evening and days later me and Coco talked about the specific shapes of this magic and found them to be, again, synchronous. To each of us a narrative. The one I’ve landed on: the magic was the magic. You should’ve been there. And this magic was the magic of us. Of our time: the days and the particular moment of our meeting, the few months we shared. The magic is the magic of us, doing the thing we love, out of love. This magic was all around us and it came and went in waves, because pure, continuous feeling is unsustainable, but it never went away. It reached its highest – the point of maximum concentration – when I read Tommaso’s words for the second time, having gathered my words and my love. Then, afterwards, when we hosted the second guided tour for strangers who, in one day, would live to see three, four exhibitions, who knows how many objects, how many labours of love. We guided them, as we were required to, but I felt that no one else was let in on the secret, the magic that we shared, because that’s not something you can give away and because we’re petty like that. And we really were like children, swimming around, in and out of the swarming schools of strangers, hyping up those for whom the time had come to stand alone and explain, in front of the public, with words reasonable and intimate enough their work, until the moment was over, the light moved away, and we were reabsorbed into our little group to be congratulated and held. Always a good word, a work of love.</p>
<p>•	Happiness feels like honey dripping into the heart. I find out happiness gifts time back and I go out of our group to see my friends, my boyfriend, to send messages to the absent and to the unwilling, because I need to tell everyone.</p>
