What came back reading his story oud loud, overwhelmed with emotion:
1.	I think that writing is constantly failing at what you love.
2.	The magic of us, of what we can do together.
3.	(I get) Flashbacks of Prague, when I was alone but I knew that I had someone waiting for me at home. The last months before leaving, all of its beauty and terror, the horrible unending hours of preparation, the time carved away for my friends. The last week, singing with Ivan at night, the hours at the bar, how slowly they advanced. The month I lived with Bea and I felt the pull to stay, to move a little bit closer. The time my brother came to visit and we walked along the same life for a little while. The morning I arrived in Paris, tired and confused, and Saou picked me up and we had a huge, improvised breakfast that went on for hours. The sunlit evenings of the first lockdown, when I forced myself to write every night and something came out of that, too, even if it didn’t have to.
4.	Me and Coco rejoiced over learning that we used the same word to describe the particular electricity of the exhibition: magic. It is not an uncommon word, maybe not one a writer should use, or do so proudly. It’s not such a spectacular coincidence that we both landed on it. But I’m not a writer and, that evening, I was drunk and sentimental and I have to stand with that, if I want to be honest. The feeling of wonderfulness of both of us having carved the same word took me over and, as usual, I let waves of words out of my mouth to expand on this joy. I searched my phone for evidence and showed Coco the first draft of this, both hoping that they’d look around it and that they wouldn’t, and pointed at this word, magic, right at the beginning. This proves something that I can’t, and don’t want, to explain.
5.	I’ve been thinking a lot about my hometowns. In my first year it was the sea that lapped my thoughts. Its certainty in my mind. The first element of my life in Italy I’ve tried to symbolize, folding layers of meaning: lines from poems, the words of friends, too, born by the sea. All along the sea was there, unchanging, and the after-image of me and my brother staring out into it, before he left. Me wondering when meaning would kick into place and fill the experience. And now that I’ve bound my heart to others here, I think about the narrow, internal streets of my first hometown, the ample roads of the second one, opening with a gasp to a sudden sky, the sea. What does missing mean. It’s the heart adjusting. I’ve found two ways: to reminisce and to remember. All that I’m doing these days is remembering. I’m here, in my life, and I stop, I remember. In the first year I reminisced. I looked upon the life I left with nostalgia. And I let it lie to me because life after the jump was hard and I needed it. Half here, half there. Promising to come back, to myself or others.
6.	I’ve weaved my heart with yours. How long doesn’t matter. Ribbons from yours are interlaced with mine now. Traces: I hope you feel the same. One day the sum of our exhibition will rise again over me and it’ll all come back to me.
7.	Something in my heart shifted, like the old cosmic mechanism that commands the eclipses, when I was reading the last words of Tommaso. I knew then that for all my rush, my imprecisions, my shortcomings, the slips of my pen and my tongue, the ritual had been successful: I knew as certainly as I knew that it was me who was speaking that Tommaso is alive; that, through procedures unknown to my own self, contingent  but not exclusive to those I used to summon him, he had made it through.
8.	We also talked, Coco and I, about the specific shapes of this magic and found them to be, again, synchronous. To each of us a narrative. The one I’ve landed on is: that magic was the magic. Such a statement has to be made. You should’ve been there. And this magic was also the magic of us. Of the time (the days and the particular moment of our meeting) that we shared, for a little while. The magic of us doing the thing we love, out of love. This magic was all around us and came and went in waves, because pure, continuous feeling is unsustainable; but it never went away. It was the highest, for me, when I read Tommaso’s words for the second time and I had gathered my intention and my love. Then, afterwards, when we hosted the second guided tour for strangers who, in one day, would live to see three, four exhibitions, who knows how many objects, how many labours of love. We guided them, for sure, but I feel like no one was let in on the secret, the secret that is the magic we shared, because that’s not something you can just share and because we’re petty like that. And we were like children, swimming around, in and out of their swarming schools of strangers, hyping up they for which the time to stand alone for a moment and find reasonable and intimate words to explain their work had come, until they moved away from the light and were reabsorbed into our group to be congratulated and held. Always a good word, a work of love.
9.	Happiness is gold dripping into the heart like honey. I find out happiness gifts time back and I want to tell everyone.
