<div class="tooltip">Du berätta aldrig om troll i kulisserna för mig. <span class="tooltiptext">You never told me about Troll in the Wings.</span> </div> I found out about it in one of those August afternoons I spent lazily browsing on my computer while you worked in the other room. The play, the second official Mumin theatre adaptation written by Tove Jansson and directed by Vivica Bandler, is known today mostly because of its beginning, in which the Mumin actors enter the stage with intact costumes to then remove their huge, fluffy heads – unmasking, amongst others, the perfectly childish smirk of Lasse Pöysti, playing Moomintrollet. This was ostensibly done to give the actors more freedom with voice and facial expressions, but a dark-internet myth has gathered around the play: children in the audience terrorized by this quasi Mumin decapitation, revealing horribly out-of-place humans inside their white, rotund bodies. In the following performances and with the TV broadcast the traumatic incident was repeated, and the play became a uniting traumatic memory for generations of Swedish children.</i></p>
