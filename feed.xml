The play, the second official Mumin theatre adaptation written by Tove Jansson and directed by Vivica Bandler, is known today mostly because of its beginning, in which the Mumin actors enter the stage with usual, intact costumes to then remove their fluffy heads – unmasking, amongst others, the perfectly childish smirk of Lasse Pöysti, playing Moomintrollet. This was ostensibly done to give the actors more freedom with voice and facial expressions, but a dark-internet myth has gathered around the play: children in the audience terrorized by this quasi Mumin decapitation, revealing horribly out-of-place humans inside their white, rotund bodies. With the following performances and the TV broadcast the incident was repeated, making the play into a uniting traumatic memory for generations of Swedish children.</i></p> <p> When I started writing this in May, I wanted to talk about childhood – mine and yours, or rather, the projection of mine on yours, because you don’t like talking about the past and I try to respect that. In the following months, with the following rewrites, I set out to find more information on this play. I was hoping to see the taking-off of the masks – to hear, if not see, the children’s reaction – but I haven’t been able to find any clips of it. In the (unofficial) Mumin wiki, which my research history states I consulted, this ‘decapitation’ is mentioned without any horrific undernotes. Were children really scared? Where did I get the idea that they were? I can't find any other hint in my web search chronology or online. While the absence of proof solidifies the status of the event as a myth, there must’ve been another source, expanding on the story to prove, once more, the Internet’s strange passion for finding the grotesque, the uncanny, the not-quite-right, the traumatising in children’s stories. And that I hadn’t just invented it. </p> <p> You have, of course, no memory of Troll I kulisserna. You were born too late; the Mumin stories you grew up with were different, safe, an uncomplicated background: there, but never essential. <span class="more_info" title="But were there other stories of horror that captured you, when you were young?">Med fanns det någon annan marginell skräck från sagor som fängslade dig när du var liten?</span> You became uneasy when, during one of my marathons, I showed you the ’70 Mumin episode in which Mårran appears for the first time. After asking me to press stop, you told me of how deeply unsettling it was, as a child, to see her towering over Sniff; mysterious, cold, silent. A creature one couldn’t make sense of, couldn’t speak to. Did you have to distinguish, then, between what your eyes just saw and the child’s memory, enlarged, made stranger against the backdrop of your mind?</p> <p> Whether I came up with it or someone else, the question is: what feelings, fake or real, were activated and subsumed into the memory of the Mumin beheading as it was passed on, shared, confused, installed in the precarious architecture of recollection - which <span class="more_info" title="pleasures and terrors">«njutningar och fasor»</span>, otherwise unspeakable, found their expression in it?</p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹 I was gifted the complete edition <span class="more_info" title="in translation">(översatt)</span> of the original Tove Jansson Mumin strips for my eighteenth birthday, long before I met you. I was only a little into them, mostly fascinated by Snufkin, but it was the gift of a friend trying to share her passion for them with me. When I told you, did you feel that I was being ungenuine, maybe inventing, doing too much - or that I was trying to steal from the cultural depository of your childhood? Is this how you felt about the latest 3D animated series, made for an international audience with puzzling British accents, that also moved me?</p> <p>Or did you just not care - had it been that long?</p> <p><span class="more_info" title="But you gifted me a Snufkin cup for my birthday last year.">Ändå gav du mig en Snusmumriken-kopp i födelsedagspresent förra året.</span> Were you letting me in on the secret, your childhood, the one thing we cannot share, no matter how much I’d like to - were you welcoming me into it or just indulging me and my childish desires?</p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹 <span class="more_info" title="I don’t remember my childhood and that’s one of the few things I can say with certainty about it.">Jag minns inte mycket från min barndom, och det är en de få saker jag kan säga med säkerhet.</span> Another one: you weren’t there. But then again, I wasn’t either. And not just in the sense that I, the person I’ve come to be, do not and cannot live there anymore - the basic fact that the membrane of childhood doesn’t allow trespassing: «my infancy is long dead and I am alive» [^1] ; but because I barely lived in that house, consumed by the business of survival, which makes ghosts of us all. My memory, the second house, made into a broken sieve, unfit for my purposes, the tasks of life.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹 I look through my notes, I look back. But I find nothing - neither proof that someone else did write about Troll i kulisserna's traumatic past, nor that I, for some reason, invented it. Reading this again, I think: if the Internet had been as it was ten, fifteen years ago - could I have started something? Do you think that someone would’ve believed me? Troll i kulisserna could’ve been one of those stories in which Internet subculture, with its inclination towards morbidity, interacts with the loose fabric of memory, which is all the looser in childhood, remaining malleable, mobile, decades after its imprinting.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹 Writing about myself is easy, as long as nobody sees. Writing about us is hard. I’m looking for a frame for us, a crowd for this room. Generations of queers have gathered in private places [^2], celebrating newborn tongues and attending to the wounds of the first years, when everything passes through the skin, that unfit membrane. When we met I went in headfirst because I felt that you could take it, that you wanted to - <span class="more_info" title="and I hope you felt the same">och jag hoppas att du kände likadant.</span> I felt myself falling in love with you (clearly, secretly) when you sat on my bed and told me of the child you were, of the story behind the scar on your left hand. I wanted to pick it up and kiss it; I don’t remember if I did. We had known each other for less than two weeks. Somewhere on your phone you have a screen recording archiving our first chats and witnessing a miraculous fact: that, in that often crude place where we met, the first pictures we sent each other were of the seas of our hometowns. There, amidst the yellow and the black, I saw the shores of Gotland and thought: I’d like to go there. Then: I think he gets it; «… <span class="more_info" title="the one pain / which is inconsolable">den smärta / som är så otröstlig</span>, the loss of one’s shore …» [^3] </p> <p><span class="more_info" title="Was it easy to receive the story of my childhood?">Var det enkelt att höra om min barndom?</span> In the beginning I wanted to tell you of the places I had escaped so that I could come to this city, where I would meet you. I wanted to put everything in sequence and see what meaning would come from it. What role you could play. Now this retroactive act is necessary to both of us, because it explains me, my resistances to you. In truth - only in telling does the pain become evident, and I can begin. Unlike Augustine, I have no God to call to, no omniscient eternal perspective to allow the retrieval of childhood under the image of eternity, the beginning act of the Western autobiography. I do not know where to begin. I need another context, an excuse - a song, a movie, a book. <span class="more_info" title="You, listening.">Du, som lyssnar.</span></p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹 I’m reading about queer memory. It’s shaping up to be a weird semester: pausing uni, trying to get therapy, writing about something new, somewhat more, somehow always less. After a few months of not approaching theory, I started reading Castiglia and Reed’s sad and exciting essay, <i>If Memory Serves</i>, on the effects of remembering and (institutional, collective) forgetting in the aftermath of AIDS. I think I need to go to the roots - of queer temporalities, of queer theories, of us, somehow, because we all exist in a world irrevocably shaped by it. <span class="more_info" title="I’m trying to learn. I’m trying to remember.">Jag försöker lära mig. Jag försöker förstå.</span></p> <p>I’ve always known that my personal memory was tattered and broken; I am starting to see that I never accessed a social, generational one as well. I have been severed not just from myself, but from an entire history of queerness - of Italian queer and trans activists (Porpora Marcasciano, Mario Mieli) who created the space in which I could’ve found rest and solace, had I dared to. But I couldn’t. The business of survival cut what remained of the thread of memory, it required me to disconnect from myself and the stories before and around me. When I walked to my high school or across the tiny streets that suddenly give way into big squares and churches in Naples, when my father drove me back home late at night, I looked away from the trans women strutting by. Was that survival again? Wasn’t that immediate fear which struck at the sight of them the beginning of this betrayal to myself, my history? This happened much later, when I wasn’t a child anymore. But I always knew where to look and, most importantly, where not to. And how can I draw a clear line between the child and the teen, when that child never died and was never really there and I live in the long aftermath of him, too?</p> <p>(I can’t say what was that severed. I can’t say yet.)</p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹 Maybe I did invent this story about Troll i kulisserna in those anguishing days of August, as I crashed at your place because my housing contract was done and I couldn’t find anything else, when our patience for each other was so thin and so much damage was done.</p> <p>In trying to make sense of this, I realize that what I find so fascinating about this mishap is its shift in logic. Although the removal of the Mumin masks has a practical explanation, that moment can be read also as revealing a raw materiality in the otherwise intact body of the Mumin. The consequences, which are immediately understood by children, are: their soft skin can be taken off; their fluffy bodies can be emptied out and inhabited by something different; this, of course, if it wasn’t a costume, a decoy, all along. This revelation raises a morbid question: what is a Mumin, actually? Is it an animal that can be killed and whose hide can be worn - or a strategy of prey? Who hides, then, in their big, friendly bodies? Why is Lasse Pöysti’s smile so unsettling? <span class="more_info" title="Danger in Moominvalley">Fora i Mumindalen - the safest of places</span>. Through this logic, the familiar and inconspicuous bodies of Muminpappa and Muminmamma become <span class="more_info" title="a skin - a membrane">en hud - ett membran</span>, as changeable as memory itself, the unstable resource for this story: mine, unable to find my sources anymore, and that of those children who, writing about it online, would’ve re-membered the event years after its passing, bringing that fear back to themselves; not unlike you, unable to stand the sight of Mårran.</p> <p>🌹 In that same August, you picked out a dub of the original 1969 Mumin anime with the original finlandssvenska accent for me, the one you grew up next to. My childhood didn’t have an accent. We watched Italian dubs of anime with the pedantic, impersonal Italian that doesn’t really belong anywhere. It was the first hint that there is not such a thing as Italy, but I wouldn’t get it until, in Berlin, I noticed that my longing called for the seas of my hometowns, Napoli och Pozzuoli, not for whatever sea touches the nation. I was ashamed of liking these shows publicly because of the kinship they inspired - Dragonball with the rowdy boy friends of my childhood, Marmalade Boy with the girls I had fragile and tentative friendships with. (I’m older now and I’m trying not to be ashamed of what I like. I bought myself a green fleece pälsmössa-like hat with a Snufkin design for my birthday; when things got dark in August, I watched the Mumin anime you had shown me - three, four episodes in a row, at times.) </p> <p>Talking about Astrid Lindgren and Tove Jansson at our first dinner, your mother got teary-eyed. My father, too, would get emotional about the Carlo Collodi stories he read as a boy. When I approached those heavy hardbacks, with their distinctly old design with a suspicious interest in order, I found them too Christian, too moralising, the language too old, too distant. My childhood, the real one, the one that came and went, wasn’t sustained by any Italian narration of childhood. The entrusting of stories from one generation to the next didn’t happen for me in the same way it did for you and maybe that’s why I latched on to yours so strongly - so strangely, so backwardly, years before I met you. </p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹Sometimes, out of nowhere, I get worried that your birthday passed and I didn’t get you anything. But I wrote you a letter. I always forget I did. I won’t repeat what it said, but I did tell you that writing a letter to you was a way to let you into this place, the only home I have; to solidify your place in the architecture of my mind, to make you part of the energy that sustains me. I sometimes think, out of the blue: there’s a queer future ahead of us. Whatever that means, it begins with a paragraph which features us both, under the rubric of an unlikely ‘us’. I know it exists because I will it - I write it. </p> <p>But for this to work, I have to trust you. <span class="more_info" title=" I have to entrust myself - my voice - to you.">Jag måste lita på mig själv - min röst – till dig.</span></p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹<span class="more_info" title=" Growing up, my father used to tell me of the time that, when he was young and on his pilgrimage to the North Pole, he stopped in Sweden. ">Under min uppväxt brukade min pappa berätta om den gången han var ung och stannade till i Sverige under sin pilgrimsfärd till Nordpolen.</span> He told me people got naked as often as possible, were very sexually open and every meal was served with jam and milk. This, as well as a few other hints like IKEA names and midsummar poles, was the context I evoked to make sense of you. But when I told you, you just laughed and said my father must’ve been somewhere else. It hurt me a bit to hear. I still repeated this anecdote over the second dinner with your parents, to be conversational and pleasant. I thought of my parents then - what language they would use to talk with you. The bravado that my father would summon to put together the very few English words he knows with whatever linguistic souvenirs of this mythological trip he could resurrect, in the spirit of that specifically Neapolitan brand of arrogance, the unfounded belief that, with their hand dialect and scraps of English, they can make themselves understood across any linguistic divide. I have no idea what my mother would do. She would probably ask me to translate, or count on her grimaces, kept alive by working with children, to communicate with you. But I won’t allow for the three of you to sit at that kitchen table; the pictures that my father took of this alleged Sweden rest somewhere in his nightstand, and I remember taking another look at them before I left - proof that, even shortly, one of us could leave. Two years ago, I asked him to send some of them to me. <span class="more_info" title=" That was the necessary prologue to me telling them about you. ">Det var den nödvändiga uppbyggnad som behövdes för att jag skulle berätta om dig för dem. </span> But he forgot, I didn’t press him, and then I stopped answering the phone when he called. Trying my hardest to make something different of my tongue, to twist it in different sounds. </p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹A memory is a chance and a liability. Allowing it invites pain in and pain always brings you back to yourself, the small confines of your body, and for the longest time I couldn’t be in that room, because it was the least safe. I’m learning how to be there - how to just be. To overcome the haunting, make the space habitable. <span class="more_info" title=" To have a spare bed, when you come over. ">Att ha en extrasäng till dig när du sover över. </span> </p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹 Then finally I figure it out. </p> <p>Looking at the Mumin wiki again for answers, I find this passage, ignored until now: <i>The same practice would return to great controversy in the 1969 show.</i> I follow the hint and it all begins to make sense. In the 1969 TV broadcast series “Mumintrollet”, a king gets hay fever by looking at the Mumin through a telescope, and orders for their snouts to be removed. While in the first episode they move (quite goofily) across the Muminhuset in their usual costumes, in the second episode a secondary character keeps Mumintrollet tied down after having tied his head to the door knob, so that when Muminpappa enter the room, the camera shows his head flying towards him. Again Lasse Pöysti’s face appears underneath, visibly shocked, touching his eyes and face, lamenting the loss of his <i>näsa.</i></p> <p>This is, somehow, much worse than what I had thought - the closest we can get to a real decapitation in a Mumin story. As I had to make peace with the idea that I came up with the story, I am shocked at how closely what I wrote about it resembles the actual show, which I had not seen before. The web results for ‘Mumintrollet 1969’, though scarce, report on screaming children, making it mandatory, for all following theatre and TV adaptations, that the Mumin wear their heads and never, never again reveal the actors hiding in their bodies.</p> <p>Does this answer everything? Can I close this chapter, now? </p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹At the first dinner with your parents, as you and your father got busy talking and switched to your tongue, I leaned in towards your mother and showed her the picture of Tove Jannson I have saved on my phone. In it, she swims blissfully in the water before her sanctuary in Klovrahun: immensely beautiful and serene, balancing a flower crown on her head. The water looks deep but she’s smiling. I’ve had it saved for years, I told her. </p> <p>I showed this to her to demonstrate the extent and the duration of my devotion, to retrace the same connection which, at the next dinner, a few months later, I would highlight with the unfaithful tale of my father’s trip. <span class="more_info" title=" I showed it to her as a talisman, knowing she’d understand its power, something both reminiscence and prophecy, to try to tell her that I understand, that I’m trying to understand. "> Jag visade den till henne som en slags talisman, Medveten om att hon förstår dess kraft. Både ett minne och en profetia. Att försöka få henne att förstå att jag förstår, att jag försöker förstå. </span></p> <p>And that I’ll take care of you. </p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹I think of you, as a baby, left outside in the Gotlandic winter to get acclimated to the cold. I don’t center my doubts that it works or even the curious, sudden memory that, as a child, I was always cold. I imagine you moving your tiny hands in the stroller, losing your soft gaze from snowflake to snowflake, falling in slow unending time. Everything moves quietly and you are not afraid; <span class="more_info" title=" you never cry. ">du gråter aldrig. </span></p> <p>No image of my childhood, real or fabricated, trasmits me this much peace. </p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹When I first met you, I had the feeling I knew you already. </p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹I want us to meet here, in this imperfection - the mess of history and timelines, us trying to make sense of it, to put the words one after the other and balance our respective powers over language. My words, your tongue. My time and your time. <span class="more_info" title=" But I trust you.">Men jag litar på dig. </span> I’m deciding to trust you. I trust that you’ll take care of me. </p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹<span class="more_info" title=" Time is at the heart of what I write. I guess it’s because, in a way, I’m always trying to go back. And the more I write, the more the old paradigm collapses: linear time and straight time, the lie that all of it points towards an absolution which, if we’re honest, will not see; that where and who you’ve been are different than the places you’ll move to and the people you will meet and become similar to. The more I become aware of this, the easier it gets for me to imagine that, maybe, forgiveness is here already, that nobody will save us and that everything is anointed; the clearer I see that the lines which extend from where I stand, anchoring themselves into the future and making waste of the past, are straight and monodirectional, that I haven’t placed them myself, that they cannot describe me or anyone I love; because the lines are actually all jumbled up, and you won’t believe where they end;">Tiden är kärnan i det jag skriver. Jag antar att det är för att jag, på ett sätt, alltid försöker gå tillbaka.

Ju mer medveten jag blir om det, destå lättare blir det att tänka mig att förlåtelsen är här redan, att ingen kommer att rädda oss och att allting är smord. Destå klarare ser jag linjerna som sträcker sig från där jag står, som ankrat fast sig i framtiden och som struntar i det förflutna, att dom är raka och enspåriga. att jag inte placerat dom än, att dom inte kan beskriva mig eller någon jag älskar; för att linjerna är egentligen huller om buller, och du kommer inte tro vart dom slutar:</span> because the past and the future are actually communicating vases, if you dare, and the present is more than just the place between them; because time is a road with multiple lanes and the atom crashes that ensue are those moments of wonderful clarity when you stop and think about the trajectories, the absolute causality and necessity of everything - <span class="more_info" title="those days of early summer, the first call of spring… "> de första dagarna av försommar, det första vårropet...</span></p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹Do you see what I mean? </p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹I’m sorry I haven’t learnt Swedish yet, baby. </p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹There’s a story I’ve been thinking about for a while. I never wrote down even a word for it, except for a note, titled “Mumin X Kafka”, which dates back to my last birthday. <span class="more_info" title=" Here it goes. ">Här kommer den. </span> A guy wakes up from restless dreams to find himself turned into a Mumintroll. As he looks down on his body, he finds it particularly white and soft, with a new, distinctive roundness, so he gets up to look for the mirror. In it, he finds big Mumin eyes staring back at him from a big, white Mumin head. The change is registered with a mixture of glee and terror, and the new Mumin falls back on his bed, unable to go on with his day. </p> <p>It’s the details that are hard to get down in this story - why glee, why terror? Then, is there a job the man has to attend to? Will he call in sick or commute in this new body, will it get dirty with the city’s smog? Where does this person’s consciousness reside - what crawlspace between body and mind? Which ultimately means: <span class="more_info" title=" what’s the real difference between being in a Mumin body or in a Mumin costume, when you’re not one?">vad är den egentliga skillnaden mellan känslan av att vara i en muminkropp eller i en muminkostym, när du inte är en? </span> Again, <i>just what is a Mumin?</i> I wanted it to be a story about this: finding out what it means to be a Mumin in a non-Mumin world, being exiled from Mumindalen, never having been there. </p> <p>I never wrote it down because, even stealing the tone and effect of the Metamorphosis, I couldn’t figure out a disguise effective enough to hide the obvious fact that it was a story about waking up in your childhood bed and not being the child you once were. </p> <p> <span class="more_info" title="In the last scene, the new Mumintrollet, having found his courage, leaves his room and takes off his Mumin head to confront his father, smoking in the kitchen, in the last hour before sunrise.">I sista scenen så har det nya mumintrollet, som hittat sitt mod, lämnat sitt rum och tagit av sitt muminhuvud för att konfrontera sin far, rökandes i köket, sista timmen innan soluppgång.</span></p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹Which words belong to whom, now?

The last months before leaving home: all of its beauty and terror, the long hours of preparations, the time carved away for my friends. The last week, singing at the night with I., the hours at the bar, which advanced slowly; the month I lived with B. and I felt the pull to stay, to move in a little closer. Beginning of an October past, when F. came to visit and we walked along the same life for a little while again. The morning I’ll arrive in Paris, battered and confused, and S. will pick me up from the station and organize a huge breakfast that will go on for hours; days later, when I’ll smoke with F. on the balcony and try to explain the kind of life I’m preparing, what still scares me. What came out of the exhibition – it will be too early for this, and I will fail, again.</li> <li>The sunlit evenings of the first lockdown, when I forced myself to write every night and something came out of that, too, even if it didn’t have to. </li> <li>The night out when me and Coco rejoiced over learning that we had used the same word to describe the particular electricity of the exhibition, <i>magic</i>. Not an uncommon word, maybe not one a writer should use proudly. But I was drunk and sentimental that evening and I must protect that feeling, too: the wonder of having carved the same word to describe the same time - a tautology of magic, inspiring, confirming itself.</li> <li>Writing the first draft of this and trying (without success) to define a difference between remembering and reminiscing.</li> <li>I’ve interlaced my heart with yours. Doesn’t matter for how long. Ribbons of yours are woven in with mine. Traces; I hope you feel the same. </li> <li>Thinking a lot about memory, my hometowns. In the first year in Berlin I missed the sea the most and I tried to make the first image of my previous life out of it – gathering lines of poems, pictures real and imagined, the words of friends, too, born by the sea, to make a figure of my own. All along the sea was there, unchanged, with the after-image of me and my brother staring out into it before he left. Me, wondering when meaning would kick into place, fill in the experience. I remember the narrow, internal streets of Pozzuoli – the ample ones of Naples, opening (with a gasp) towards a sudden sky, the sea. What does missing mean? It’s only the heart adjusting. In my first months, I lied to it and let myself reminisce, promising to come back, until it didn’t matter anymore. Corners of Berlin make me cry, now. Every time I walk along Potsdamer Strasse I think of you, of us. The time me and Agata walked three or four bus stations from the Kunstraum and talked about twins and doubles of many kinds and it was sweet to have someone to speak in Italian with.</li> <li>I’ve tried to talk to each of them about the specific shape of this magic. This is what I’ve landed on: the magic was the magic. <i>You should’ve been there</i>. This magic was the magic of us. Of our time: the days of our meeting, the few months we shared, that sacred week before the opening. This magic was the magic of us, doing the thing we love. The magic was us and emanated all around from us and it came and went in waves, because pure feeling is unsustainable, but never went away. I remember blue make-up powder being put in a old salad bowl and then shared. The kitchen, our retreat, which Richie’s costumes made into a backstage, a theatre of its own. Then we went into the exhibition. </li> <li>You must develop a technique. Then you must develop another. You must have a method for summoning and you must not abuse it. You must learn how to distinguish between what must be summoned and what suffices to be recalled or imagined. Don’t call what doesn’t need to called. <i>Dream new dreams</i>. </li> <li>The magic reached its peak in two moments: when I read Tommaso’s words for the second time, after Véra instructed me on how to gather my words. Then, afterwards, when we hosted the second guided tours for strangers who would, in one day, see three or four exhibitions, who knows how many labours of love. We guided them and I felt like, for how much we tried, for how much they wanted to, they’d never be part of the magic, because it belonged to us, it emerged from these months of contact, the daily company in the week of the installation. And I felt we were like children of the same kind, strange and aslant, swimming around in a tight pack, in and out of the swarming schools of strangers, as we hyped up those for whom the time had come to explain their work (with words reasonable and intimate enough), until the moment was over, the light moved to the next piece and we reabsorbed into our group to be congratulated and held. Always a good word, always a work of love. We all hugged in front of Eze's glass trinkets, reflecting complex lights, or maybe not at all.</li> <li>When I called Mattia the last morning of the installation because nothing worked and I was ashamed of being so unprofessional and in the same room with you all he calmed me down and promised me <i>we</i>’d find a way. Mascha helped me put up the pages, stayed with me, patient and with unshakable faith in the success of our endeavour. </li> <li>The last day, before we had to leave, I went and sat down in Lu and Coco’s embryonal space. I closed my eyes, I let the sounds of water and whispers align my breath into a kinder rhythm. I made space for memory, for being there. </li> <li>I knew that something in my heart had shifted (like an old cosmic mechanism commanding the eclipse and the seasons of the moon) as I read the last words of Tommaso. I knew then that, despite my imprecisions, my rushing, my shortcomings, the slips of my pen and my mouth, despite myself, that Tommaso is alive, that he had made it through, that the ritual had been successful.</li> <li>I realized last week, getting sentimental again with Lula, that I’m not done talking about this. I don’t want to exhaust the magic, to say it all. </li> <li>Happiness is honey dripping into the heart. I move around our group like a zealot (in the blue coat Jean-Noël said made me look like a gay wizard), I want to know of everyone, I need everyone of us to know; then I step out of our swarm to see my friends, my boyfriend, to send messages to the absent and the unwilling, because I need to tell everyone that the magic was happiness and I found out that happiness gifts time back.</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">storia di tommaso (september 2023)</title><link href="https://pinetree27.github.io/blog/2024/storia-di-tommaso/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="storia di tommaso (september 2023)"/><published>2024-04-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pinetree27.github.io/blog/2024/storia%20di%20tommaso</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pinetree27.github.io/blog/2024/storia-di-tommaso/"><![CDATA[<p>Exhibition with <a href="https://www.agatahoerttrich.com/queerthingstaketime">Agata Hörttrich</a>, Coco Wiss, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ezehyon/">Ezequiel Hyon</a>, <a href="https://bueronoelle.com/">Jean-Noël Teschauer</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jilschuberth/">Jil Schuberth</a>, Lu Herbst, <a href="http://lulabornhak.com/">Lula Bornhak</a>, <a href="https://majazagorska.com/">Maja Zagórska</a>, Mascha Naumann, <a href="https://mattiafriso.com/">Mattia Friso</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/targetlady/">Richard Müller</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scek_art/">Steve C.E.

Result of the Queer Things Take Time workshop and exhibited in the omonimous exhibition in September 2023, it is a novella informed by concepts of queer temporalities. Set in the first part of the 20th century in South Tyrol, the story is told over multiple languages and perspectives of witnesses to one man’s story who, during the Italian colonisation of the land and its subsequent attack on Ethiopia, tried to define himself across the the frames and temporalities of Christianity and Italianess.</p> <p><em>First cluster: prologue / part V: the gospel of Tommaso / epilogue</em></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/blog_posts/posts/qttt-cluster1-1.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/blog_posts/posts/qttt-cluster1-1.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/blog_posts/posts/qttt-cluster1-1.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/blog_posts/posts/qttt-cluster1-1.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Introduction and conclusion to the story with words from the heart of the story, Tommaso's perspective.

Dozing off on the bus from Krumme Lanke to my room in Schlachtensee, I often found myself thinking back to the child I was - this intruder, this unknown, this obstinate dissonance in my story, a him refusing being dealt away with. I found myself stuck between this sudden necessity to remember and the scarceness of my memories, the hardness of those which had coagulated into silence, unspeakability.</p> <p>I looked for a frame for him, something to hold him into place, together. I watched Petite Fille and I found a her and then something else running alongside them, children and phantoms sharing the same game, the same running. The semester we met was quite calm; I was preparing my work. In the following, I read about queer temporalities for the first time, and found out that it had already been written about the child. While José Esteban Muñoz tried to redeem the future (and the value of hope and utopian feeling) from the cynicism of Leo Bersani and Lee Edelmann, the latter argued vehemently against it and, with it, the child, seen as the political vanguard of conservative, homophobic thinking. Writing at the same time as Muñoz, Kathrin Bond Stockton asked: how can we think about the child in a way that is neither utopic nor dismissive? And, what is a child after all?</p> <p>In order to answer that, Stockton makes a critical distinction between the child and the Child; between actual, living (‘historical’) children and the ideological category of the Child, against which real children are confronted and understood. In doing this, she links her argument with Edelman who, in “No Future”, describes the Child as a political plan enacted to secure the ‘future’ exclusively through (heterosexual-ist) reproduction. Consequently, this Child is the ideal continuation of the political ruling class: undoubtedly white, cissexual and straight, imagined as a powerless, a-sexual being in need of constant protection. Any other child - racialised, non-straight, gender-nonconforming, sexual - is not granted this security, is excluded from the category of the Child, from the white matrix, denied empathy, care, protection. As much as Edelmann argues for resistance against the Child and tries to define other worthwhile investments of queer energy, I find Stockton much more interesting, because she centers the life and experience of these real, living children; because she brings me much closer to the child which I actually was.</p> <p>(<span class="more_info" title="Did you feel safe in your childhood?">Kände du dig otrygg i din barndom?</span> Who protected you, and from what? I must’ve been safe because I am white, mostly passed as straight. But it didn’t feel safe. It felt like walking on a line - the balancing effort took all of my energy because I was aware of the dangers that follow transpassing. I think the violence I was exposed to came from that; as if living on a string meant I had deserved it, or that no one would believe me, if I talked. <span class="more_info" title="In which ways were you allowed or not allowed to be a child?">På vilka sätt kände du att du tilläts vara ett barn?</span>)</p> <p>Stockton remarks that, even separating it from the Child, we do not come closer to understanding what a child is. A child is an ineffective definition, understood as it is exclusively in negative terms: as a non-adult, characterized by innocence (as absence of sin, in the sexual sense). Once one escapes the rigid armour of the Child, it becomes clear that this reduction does not and can not account for the complexity of the life of a child: the «pleasures and terrors we recall» <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, shadows of pre-sexuality, the tangled, inexplicable feelings that are too big for words, which almost place one outside of childhood. Somewhere between being a child and remembering the child, in growing up, the transmission goes wrong, and if we settle on the placating definition of ‘child’, <span class="more_info" title="a climate of suspicion, unspeakability, loss, still comes to hover over the real childhoods we had">[MISSING]</span>.</p> <p>It is hard to gauge a child’s understanding of itself, too; self-definition is obstructed by legal and social traditions that decide what a child is, what it should be, by shaping the idea of the Child. This becomes much harder for what we, backwardly, call queer children: when the vocabulary of queerness, of sexual difference, is not made available to the child (too adult, reeking too strongly of sex, of perversion), how can a child express the perceived difference between itself and its surroundings? Despite this, Stockton finds a surprising abundance of metaphors flourishing from children, lapping this very impossibility: one, for example, calling himself a «gay dolphin» (1); weird and aslant expressions that do their best to evade the cage of the category of Childhood. <span class="more_info" title="What did I call myself? What did you call yourself? Was ‘gay’ attractive or painful to you?">Vad sade jag om mig själv? vad sade du om dig själv? var “bög” attraktivt eller kanske sårande för dig?</span>. I stayed in the safety of being unnamed as long as I could. I measure the extent of the violence also by this fact: that I already knew, always knew, that to be named is to be made visible, and to be made visible is to be put in danger. I still ask myself how could I know this. Is there an opposite to growing up - time travel? Did I, as I am and know today, somehow (impossibly) go back and explain to myself the rules of survival, so that I could be safe? Isn’t that the God Augustine calls to - the one which calls back; this conscience which is most easily explained in writing? <span class="more_info" title="Do you see what I mean? Do you see what I mean somewhat more clearly, now?">Förstår du var jag menar? ser du vem du var tydligare än?</span></p> <p>Because of the hardships which she faces in trying to define what a child is, Stockton asks: is there such a thing as a child? <span class="more_info" title="And you - did you ever feel like a child? What did that mean to you?">Och du - kände du dig som ett barn? Vad betydde det för dig?</span>. There is only one possible definition of the child which bears witness to this complexity: «precisely who we are not and, in fact, never were» (5). She concludes, dishearteningly: a child is nothing but <i>«the act of adults looking back»</i> (5, emphasis mine). It is precisely this gesture, this defeat, this holding of complexity, which interests me, because it risks explaining what I felt. Ultimately, Stockton articulates the identity of the child by marking its distinction from the Child, distinguishing between what the child is and what it is wanted to be, what it is accepted to be, but, most importantly, <i>in and through the architecture of memory</i>.</p> <p>Confined in straightjackets of definitions, explained only through negations, every child suffers severe consequences: «such a child, with no established forms to hold itself in the public, legal field, has been a child remarkably, intensely <i>unavailable to itself in the present tense»</i> (6, my emphasis). A child is a being between adulthood and whatever comes before it, caught between its own perception and the invasive gaze of others: a changeling, a bortbyting. Essentially strange, queer, maybe, children exist in a middle space between life and memory, experience and recollection: its life is lived (so Stockton) between one’s own body and the category of the Child. For some of us, for myself, the body itself becomes inaccessible, and it is a life’s work to regain it. What we call a child is the result of a «backward birth» (6), born out of this act of looking back into the being we were and are no more, a retractive creation installed in the process of memory and recollection, between the layers of this one body which becomes double. <span class="more_info" title="Who were you, as a child? Is it still you? Were you always yourself?">[MISSING]</span>.</p> <p>I am trying to articulate, with the help of Stockton’s text, a definition of childhood as a «membrane», an interstitial space, a void in-between, a mezzanine that is barely accessible to the child, but «largely available to adults as memory» (5). The Child imposes itself like a second skin, impossible to distinguish from the first one<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, imposing pressures and limitations, dictating what a child is, what it cannot be. A troubling degree of voyeurism haunts this definition: the child spies through the keyhole of the Child (of its body its memory) into others, into the other children and the space of living they are afforded, into the mysterious life of the adults, and into itself, its own life, body, experiences.</p> <p>As I move across my memories, to try and revive them, to make sense of what happened, as I try and access this membrane, the «the pleasures and terrors» woven in its fabric - the memories, real or not, of the Mumin beheading, of that vast blue silence, all of the things I can’t say yet - <span class="more_info" title="I am not returning to the child, but inventing it">[MISSING]</span>. I describe him with a vocabulary of feeling and identity that is available to me only, only in the afterwards, having reached ‘adulthood’. And the child changed too, over the years - depending on the time of access, as my understanding of myself changed, as it became necessary to either install or rescue strands of emotions and thoughts that I see continuing now, in the aftermath. Said with Stockton, the child is ultimately an effect of memory, as intangible as it is, an ever-imperfect attempt to resolve the first queer autobiographical question: «when did you know?» (2). This matter can be hardly settled and approached only retroactively, by turning one’s gaze towards the past which couldn’t be defined in the time of its presence. Only as an adult can I look back - and this child must die, give way to me, for me to be able to call him queer. His death must be accompanied by another death: the death of what Stockton calls the “straight child”, a manifestation of the Child structure highlighting the pressures and expectations that are supposed to catapult the child from its presumed a-sexuality into open heterosexuality. I must declare the death of the straight child for me to find the queer child - this unknown who lived desperately and proficiently in lack and in need of words, in hiding. It is only at a basic removal, at some distance - an international move, so many years of forgetting - that I might be able to reconcile myself with that child, to give it the space it needed. <span class="more_info" title="How far I’ve had to go to find you">[MISSING].</span></p> <p>There is, of course, a significant degree of arbitrarity to this. How can I say with any certainty: <span class="more_info" title="_I was a queer child?_ Were you? Can anyone be?"><i>jag var queen som barn?</i> Var du? Kan man ens vara det?</span> Every language proves insufficient, every vocabulary fails. I always had, like any child, complex desires for touch, proximity, affection, and they extended both to little girls and little boys. I don’t know if that’s enough to invoke queerness. I cannot know of my gender, too, if my sense of being non-binary today (this refusal of loud, brawling masculinity, this move towards gender expansion, questioning) can be traced back to my little games and aversions; which is to say, if I can extend my understanding of myself this far into the past. I have found hints, not one proof. I can’t say anything for certain - whether I was or wasn’t a boy, if I wanted to be; if boyhood ever meant anything to me or if it was just the hide that’d keep me the safest. <span class="more_info" title="My memories shift and spill like watercolour, and I don’t know where to begin">[MISSING]</span>. Stockton’s discourse, in her intentional, sweeping generalization of childhood as queer, pays the just tribute to the complexities of childhood; to the very real experience of conflicting feelings, statements, oblique and cross desires that (this somehow I remember so clearly) occur daily in a child’s mind, before we must learn to give it confines, before the walls are made to rise, so much taller than us.</p> <p>In this light, recollection appears as the process not just to bring memories back to oneself, but to re-inhabit the space between who one is and was, between the remembering adult and the remembered child, as well as the membrane between the child and the Child, the space of experience of the child itself, in which the feelings appeared and the memories were produced. I must declare this process impossible, too. Recollection always fails: the memories are volatile, ever-changing, prone to defect, corruption. The child remains unexplainable, inaccessible.</p> <p>I believe in this. But I know there’s degrees to the unfathomability of childhood. Maybe there are some truths about yours: memories you feel you can trust. But that’s not true for me. I have forgotten so much that was essential to who I was and the few memories which remain are the ones I cannot look at yet. All of this rests on a simple fact: I’m not sure what happened. (I was made not to be sure about what happened). I had to forget, to distance myself from the event, the memory.</p> <p>This matters not because I want to prove an essentialist sense of queerness, a timeline which from childhood leads directly into my present now - but because queerness, I believe, is a way of kinship, of connection - if I were a queer child, what (or who) can I connect that child with? What theories might I use to understand him? The result is this impossible answer - or rather, a multiplication of answers, all imperfect, all temporary, which give way into writing, into these words I try to give you.</p> <p>Sharpening a definition of “child” that accounts for these <i>pleasures and terrors</i> also makes space for this desire we have, as the last generation that grew between the offline and the online, when the Internet was a world still mysterious, both infinite and very small - between proto-Youtube and school courtyard tales, to find the scary and the traumatising in the medias of our childhood. I cannot claim to have taken part in any of the Mandela effects that could’ve been accessible to me as an Italian kid growing up in the early 2000s, but I remember reading scary stories on Italian blogs (bad translations, but still effective), being terrorized by forcing myself to watch TV documentaries on the seven apparitions of Mary, the Mothman or reptilians; accessing the chunky Youtube of the time to watch videos about Lavender Town, being scared sleepless about its implications: dying of frequencies that only a child could hear. Years later, I would find the Troll i kulisserna/Mumintrollet story, and invest in it so deeply that I couldn’t help but write about it - the moment from which all of this started.</p> <p>(<span class="more_info" title="What does this say about me, about my childhood? Where do I go from here?">Vad säger det om mig, om barndom? Det barn jag tydligen varit?</span>)</p> <p><span class="more_info" title="Terror was the easiest way I could reach myself">[MISSING]</span>; nothing brought me back to my body as efficiently as night sweats, extending my eyes into the room at night to see what I wanted to see, what I feared I would see, if only I tried hard enough, which I had to in order to protect myself; playing with turning the TV on and off, closing and opening the creepypasta blogs - fort, da. Mask on, off.</p> <p>Stockton touches only lightly on trauma in reference to Freud’s theory of Nachträglichkeit, his original understanding of trauma as “deferred action”, an impression that is impossible for the (child) brain to process and incorporate and, as such, remains latent in the mind. This unprocessed knot of feelings and memory can be later activated during a re-exposure, when a similar event brings out the original traumatic memory, or during psychoanalysis. Only through this activation is the original traumatic event constructed, <i>retroactively</i> (nachträglich), as such, and that its latent effect (protecting the psyche by avoiding situations that could’ve re-ignited it) becomes seen and understandable. Like the child, trauma is created posthumously. But Stockton remarks a fundamental difference: the child can be aware of this state of deferral, of its delay; it might « await only (the right to claim) a word, not a mental state of being, withheld from them in childhood.» (15).</p> <p><span class="more_info" title="As a child I was so terribly aware of myself.">Som barn var ja så förfärligt självmedveten.</span> I tried to grow up as quickly as I could, I shifted into a space within myself where, in hiding, I would observe the adults, their mannerisms, the topics of their conversations, and tried my best to emulate them. The result of my efforts was a grotesque parody, something sombre, saddening and slightly troubling - more <i>bortbytling</i> than child. I really started to think of myself as an adult in a child’s body, because there was no space for me to hold my feelings and remain a Child. I became reckless, desperate, to grow up: I walked away with disgust from any diminutives, any -ino (which meant walking away from myself, too, as a bambino), from anything I perceived childish, from age-appropriate books; I insisted on inflating my vocabulary with big and abstruse words, and delighted when the adults, halfway buying my performance, talked to me as an adult, sometimes confided in me. Now I can’t help but see the dangers of being perceived as older. <span class="more_info" title="I don’t know if this was a consequence of the abuse or a prelude to it.">Jag vet inte om det var en konsekvens av misshandel.</span> Eventually, when the first hairs started poking out of my upper lip, I celebrated a sad victory - somehow knowing already that, though an era of powerlessness was coming to its end, becoming a boy would bring its unique and terrifying consequences, too. (How could I have known already?)</p> <p>When I look back to my memories, my point of view hangs far above my eyes, somewhere over my head. It’s always been like this and I cannot tell, now, whether this was a practical consequence of my emotional and physical dissociation, or the aftereffect of my distance as an adult which I install in the past. As if there had been some truth to my feeling of being an adult in a child’s body, I see myself as if I were walking by my side, a vaporous conscience above myself. As an image, it indicates quite nicely that it is impossible to define who I was without acknowledging where I’m throwing my gaze from now, as well as that there wouldn’t be a child without the adult to remember him. There would not be an adult without a child who, despite everything, including himself, made it through.</p> <p>Being a child, living inside of this membrane, <span class="more_info" title="at the same time inside and outside childhood">[MISSING]</span>, must’ve meant living halfway there, halfway here. Never fully in one place, never able to produce a clear, uncontestable memory. This membrane, the space I retreated inside of as a child and at the same time the difference between who I am now and who I was, becomes the access point to my life - present or past. If it still makes sense to distinguish between the two. <span class="more_info" title="I lost the child, I lost memory.">Jag förlorade barnet och jag förlorade minnet.</span></p> <p>Inside the room of childhood, I listen to the sounds from the neighboring walls, observe the flickering of a flame through their semi-transparent fabric. Someone’s in the other room. These walls are the membrane - some of them hardened by the Child, obstructing communication, sight. My life is happening in the other room. I can see shadows of it, never the whole. He can see me too - how far I’ve come - but not enough. I hope it’s enough to vaporize into hope for him, what we used to call destiny, or the god of broken cobblestones. The wall is a womb and a thick membrane and, through the blood, the amniotic liquid, the light sometimes shines through, and sometimes I can see him looking back at me. Most of the time the bortbytling keeps quiet, and I know he’s there just because of the way the light hits his figure, casting a terrible shadow. Some nights I find it’s myself, not him, to be wailing. In the hours before dawn, as the candleflame dies and the sun is gone, it sometimes becomes impossible to distinguish between him, who managed to survive childhood, and me who’s been survived. There’s always a wailing, always a calling - <span class="more_info" title="to make sure that, on the other side, there’s someone listening.">ett kall som säkerställer att, på andra sidan, ha någon som lyssnar.</span></p> <p>For both of us, desire for «meaningful plenitude»<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> is impossible. We wish to see what’s in the other room, what has or will happen, but we can’t. We make the best of ourselves out of the glimpses we catch, incorporating them into bigger narratives which, with time, we must shed like snakeskin. Complete vision - complete memory - is impossible. I sit in the room and listen, my ear to the wall.</p> <p>Maybe I am allowed a childhood only now that I am out of the labyrinth. The memories of what hurt are crystallised, safeguarded, and the membrane between me and them is surprisingly clear, though opaque. Awaiting, maybe, «the right to claim a word» I don’t know yet, or knew all along. As I look to the wall in front of me, I create the child in the other room, and the difference between imagination and memory gets thinner. He rebels, of course, and I must pay attention to do right by him. In this membrane, past and present merge into one, and I am left with this calling, the grief of this unbridgeable distance, and the vague shape of a future project on a wall I haven’t turned to in so long.</p> <p>🌹 We talk about this. I convince you. We spend a long afternoon, then a long evening, trying to translate all of this into your mother tongue, rushed by a deadline I wasn’t careful enough to anticipate. I sit on the sofa, you at the desk, working away. Sometimes you ask me what I mean with this or that. I try to tell you, but the afternoon’s fight still reverberates across my ability to explain myself. I don’t want to do this anymore.</p> <p>Every other time that we talked about this - me writing about my childhood, about us - you sounded excited. I was happy to see you involved, interested in my work. But this is not what I wanted. You resent me for this.</p> <p>It will take me a long time - even after Gotland - to realize that I had messed up my expectations, the workload. All of this because I couldn’t say this: will you please look at this I wrote? It’s for you. It’s about you. I want you to be part of it, too. I want our names to exist together, next to one another, on a page.</p> <p>🌹 We fought once and, in the crying and reconciling that comes afterwards, you were pointedly honest and said something that I didn’t think would’ve hurt me. Then, to my surprise, I found a breathlessness rising in my chest and I observed myself as I ran to the bathroom, locked myself in there. In the memory, the camera follows me from above, like some kind of action scene, or a nature documentary. <span class="more_info" title="You ran after me and waited outside, terrified.">Du sprang efter mig och väntade utanför, förskräckt.</span> Inside, I dealt with the first panic attack of my life. In the mist-like texture of memory, which is also my life, the words you had said on the sofa mixed themselves curiously with my mother’s voice, even though I can’t ever remember her saying anything similar to what you did, my body reacted to it nonetheless. When I got out, you apologized. I was delighted. The panic your words caused in me proved two things: first, that our relationship had alchemized that unique chemistry of safety and challenge, allowing us to keep moving; secondly, the existence of something true inside of myself, a feeling of hurt so deep and unquestionable that it had to mobilize my whole body to work through it. It proved that I had actually been hurt - that the memories were not wrong; <span class="more_info" title="that they could be awakened - by you.">att dom kunde väckas till liv - av dig.</span></p> <p>🌹 I had never really looked at that picture. This is the only picture of my childhoodI still have on my computer. I was playing a little violet plastic piano, he a silver saxophone, also plastic. I don’t know if I’m smiling, smirking, or looking a little terrified at the camera. It changes everytime I look.</p> <p>We are standing in front of our desk. We are right in front of the one that, years later, would become mine. We never changed them. I just remembered I used to hide in there. I would put my face against the little space between the desk and the wall, where a little cold air would come through, and breathe really slowly. So as to no make a sound.</p> <p>I cry for a few seconds, then it’s over again.</p> <p>🌹 It gets better. We forget the incident. The excitement of being done with it also helps. I receive your impressions of the project, I archive them inside of them. I share a few of mine, trying not to hurt either of us. But we did it. We didn’t give up on this. We land on something different than what I had imagined - something which, over time, I will begin to recognise as ours.</p> <p>🌹 As I was researching this text, I began reading more about Tove Jansson. I found out that, as per the custom of the time, she referred to lesbians (and herself) as “ghosts”.</p> <p>🌹 We didn’t watch All of Us Strangers (Haigh, 2023) together. I needed a space of feelings encumbered by anyone else’s presence, by their feelings, their reaction to mine. (I went with Eesha, but we agreed to sit at opposite sides of the movie hall and reconvene later.) It’s also true that I’m not very good at letting you in. When we talked about it, later, I tried to tell you about what I had seen, but I failed. <span class="more_info" title="But this is me trying.">Men det här är jag som försöker.</span></p> <p>One of the most striking moments happens when, halfway across the movie, Adam stays the night in the impossible house of his parents. As he wakes up from troubled sleep, he’s wearing the pajama of his childhood self, strained painfully, comically, over his adult body, like a costume. As with Stockton’s membrane, Adam accesses his childhood by re-inhabiting the skin (clothes) of the child he was, making memory physical, a space that can be embodied, allowing him access to the his childhood in an unprecedented way. These are the last moments of Adam’s journey into the past, as the membrane becomes the thinnest, the most dangerous. When he, unable to sleep, slips into his parent’s bedroom and has a nighttime conversation with his mother, he finds out that, in this trespassing of the barrier between adult and child, all of his terror and grief which inhabited his childhood have made it through, too. Like a child, he’s looking for reassurance: Like Stockton’s child and Freud’s Nachträglichkeit, the past must be reactivated in order to be made available, to be processed. In the beginning of the movie, Adam lives a monotonous and safe life, until a chance encounter with someone he’d like to love acts as a catalyst for the mechanism of memory. Only after Harry, because of him, does the membrane between childhood and adult self become available and Adam gets to meet his parents, who died in a car accident when he was little. Only after knowing them as an adult, and letting himself be known (coming out, too), does the continuation of the story, and love, become possible.</p> <p>After the night in his parent’s house Adam wakes up in his own bed and finds shelter from his night terror in Harry. As he stands up, Adam opens up for the first time and tells him of the grief of losing his parents, the uncomfortableness of growing up in the aftermath of HIV, moving to the big city, losing friends, finding himself stuck in a life without much joy but also without pain. All of this, he admits, mixed to become the same feeling: « I felt like the future didn’t matter ».</p> <p><span class="more_info" title="Our disagreement over the movie lay in the fact that you read it as a ghost story and a tragedy and I couldn’t">Vår oenighet över filmen ligger i faktumet om att du ser den som en tragedi.</span></p> <p>Adam has one last lunch with his parents and, this time, gets to say goodbye to them. Afterwards, instead of going to his apartment and waiting for Harry to come up, he heads to his place for the first time. As he opens the doror, he finds his friend’s body, rotting. Harry enters the room and Adam tries to convince him to go out, but he insists on staying, admitting, in between tears, that he can smell his own body. He must’ve killed himself months before, when, after their first meeting, Adam (still crystallized in his loneliness and grief) rejected him. But he eventually manages to convince him and, in the last scene, Adam hugs Harry in his own bed, as the camera pans away from them, until nothing but darkness and one bright star appear. You saw that as the last moment of happiness granted to them. But I don’t think so. When Adam carries Harry into his room, he’s not just accompanying him towards the light. In the scene before, as they find Harry’s body, it can be identified because it is wearing the same clothes he was wearing during that first encounter - the same salmon sweater that Harry wears when he enters the room, carrying the same bottle of gin that he offered Adam at his doorstep, before he rejected him. In Harry’s room, the past of his death coexists with a present in which he is still alive.</p> <p>I believe that, as Adam went back to touch the membrane of his childhood, he became able to break the one that separates the past from the present, too. As he intervenes to stop Harry from touching his own body, as he hugs him to sleep, <span class="more_info" title="he’s not accepting his death: he’s re-writing history, he’s changing the past.">en gåva, ledandes in i en ny framtid, som gjordes möjlig genom att ändra det förflutna.</span> His engagement with the past has awakened the dead, yes, but also made other configurations of the present possible; coming from an alternative future in which he did have a relationship with Harry, he visits the past of that first night and is able to intervene in it, to save Harry, to establish a new time.</p> <p>This is what I wanted to tell you. I don’t want us to be ghosts. I want happiness for us now.</p> <p>I’m trying to learn how to read hope, baby.</p> <p>🌹 What else I can say about my childhood:</p> <p>As a child I was not safe. None of us were. I was aware of this and aware that it was wrong to feel like this. Because my heartbreak and my grief and my anger could not be held anywhere, because I was required to live in unsafe conditions without the power to change them, I created an ever-growing distance between myself, my body and feelings. To feel in charge, to regain some sense of control, I played with the balance between safety and danger, with horror, scaring myself and others. So much of what happened, of what I was set to become, was outside of my control. The mask was taken off even when I asked it to stop. I had to watch it happen all throughout my childhood. One moment you’re safe, the next you’re not. This child is alive in me and he sometimes screams at you for what you ask of me, for what you don’t give, for what I don’t know how to ask.</p> <p>But I also know something else. <span class="more_info" title="I’m trying to tell you that there was a kernel of you in my childhood.">Jag försöker berätta för dig att det fanns en kärna av dig i min barndom.</span> I’ve been trying to gather the pieces, to write it all together, and I wanted you to have a part, too. Because if my memory remains shadowy, exposed to stronger winds that bend it and shape it beyond my will, if the whole category of childhood couldn’t sustain me, couldn’t keep me safe, then maybe I was never a child, if anyone can be. Maybe I’m just learning now how to be one. Maybe you’re teaching me.</p> <p>If whatever child I can call to is a construction, if I cannot penetrate the membrane anyhow, if I am doomed to living with the ghost of him, then maybe I can see that he’s still here, and I did save him, I did save us; andif my memory is intangible and changeable, if both queerness and the absence of it are inventions, if I cannot write what happened without being so fucking afraid that someone would dismiss it, challenge it, counter it – if there are no facts now that I can appeal to, if there wasn’t anyone ever to help me, then I was never inside of the reality of the Child. Maybe, then, I can take that skin off and write a different story, call it autobiography. In it, zapping through afterhours Italian TV channels, I did stumble upon a Mumin cartoon – upon Tofslan och Vifslan, lovers or twins, and the Groke, who didn’t frighten me. Maybe my father did go to Sweden, and he brought something sweet and intangible, a handful of perfect snow, which I picked up from the nightstand before I left. If I have no recollections I can serve myself with, then I can take the leap and call my writing my memory.</p> <p>If there was a time in which the two of us were kids at the same time, I can record this simple chronological fact in sequence and make it aslant by adding <i>tilsammans</i>. The story, impossible to prove, goes: on one afternoon of primary school the child you were, your left hand still unscarred, took the hand of the child I was in the courtyard, and the affection we discovered in that September of two years ago has not been invented, it rather moved across history from that one afternoon towards this time and space, to meet the people we are, who have forgotten, and illuminate childhood with its possibility.</p> <p>Because if you were there, in my childhood – then it becomes easier for me to believe that there was goodness there, too, and kindness and understanding and love, and that the punishment for my trespasses didn’t ruin me; I then remember that I wasn’t alone, I never was, and that there was play too, and fun, because despite my malaise, my terminal seriousness, we play sometimes and it’s nice, it’s just fucking nice, and sometimes we play this game called ‘fantasy of a house’ where I tell you why I sometimes lash out at you and you tell me why you can’t believe my good faith – the missing page, that which will not be written.</p> <p>Eventually we go to bed. Turning the light off, you ask me to hug you and I do, just before you fall asleep, you before me always. With my head full of the work of the day (the dissatisfaction with the way words flow, the rare moments where it becomes easy), I see clearly that, in this little bed, we are moving back in time as well as onwards, while being perfectly grounded in the present, like a sturdy island in a storm; then, for the first time in my life, the future opens up like the sea, infinite and safe, seen from <span class="more_info" title="this happy room we write together.">i detta lyckliga rum vi skrev tilsammans.</span></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>Kathryn Bond Stockton, The Queer Child, or Growing Sideways in the Twentieth Century, Duke University Press, 2009, page 6. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>TThis connection between temporal regimes (as the Child, ultimately, is a way to control that phase of human growth) and somatic experience brings me back to an insight of Elizabeth Freeman, who, in “Time Binds”, described the chrononormative nature of capitalistic, heterosexualist time as a «somatic fact», that is to say, the way that thisis made to appear natural because of its inscription into the body and its rhythms/cycles. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>The quote is from Samyel Delaney’s “The Motion of Light in Water”, Arbor House, 1998, quoted in José Esteban Muñoz, Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity, NYU Press, 2019, page 59.
