The play, the second official Mumin theatre adaptation written by Tove Jansson and directed by Vivica Bandler, is known today mostly because of its beginning, in which the Mumin actors enter the stage with usual, intact costumes to then remove their fluffy heads – unmasking, amongst others, the perfectly childish smirk of Lasse Pöysti, playing Moomintrollet. This was ostensibly done to give the actors more freedom with voice and facial expressions, but a dark-internet myth has gathered around the play: children in the audience terrorized by this quasi Mumin decapitation, revealing horribly out-of-place humans inside their white, rotund bodies. With the following performances and the TV broadcast the incident was repeated, making the play into a uniting traumatic memory for generations of Swedish children.</i></p> <p> When I started writing this in May, I wanted to talk about childhood – mine and yours, or rather, the projection of mine on yours, because you don’t like talking about the past and I try to respect that. In the following months, with the following rewrites, I set out to find more information on this play. I was hoping to see the taking-off of the masks – to hear, if not see, the children’s reaction – but I haven’t been able to find any clips of it. In the (unofficial) Mumin wiki, which my research history states I consulted, this ‘decapitation’ is mentioned without any horrific undernotes. Were children really scared? Where did I get the idea that they were? While the absence of proof solidifies the status of the event as a myth, there must’ve been another source, expanding on the story to prove, once more, the Internet’s strange passion for finding the grotesque, the uncanny, the not-quite-right, the traumatising in children’s stories. And that I hadn’t just invented it. </p> <p> You have, of course, no memory of Troll I kulisserna. You were born too late; the Mumin stories you grew up with were different, safe, an uncomplicated background: there, but never essential. <span class="more_info" title="But were there other stories of horror that captured you, when you were young?">Med fanns det någon annan marginell skräck från sagor som fängslade dig när du var liten?</span> You became uneasy when, during one of my marathons, I showed you the ’70 Mumin episode in which Mårran appears for the first time. After asking me to press stop, you told me of how deeply unsettling it was, as a child, to see her towering over Sniff; mysterious, cold, silent. A creature one couldn’t make sense of, couldn’t speak to. Did you have to distinguish, then, between what your eyes just saw and the child’s memory, enlarged, made stranger against the backdrop of your mind?</p> <p> Whether I came up with it or someone else, the question is: what feelings, fake or real, were activated and subsumed into the memory of the Mumin beheading as it was passed on, shared, confused, installed in the precarious architecture of recollection - which <span class="more_info" title="pleasures and terrors">«njutningar och fasor»</span>, otherwise unspeakable, found their expression in it?</p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹 I was gifted the complete edition <span class="more_info" title="in translation">(iöversatt)</span> of the original Tove Jansson Mumin strips for my eighteenth birthday, long before I met you. I was only a little into them, mostly fascinated by Snufkin, but it was the gift of a friend trying to share her passion for them with me. When I told you, did you feel that I was being ungenuine, maybe inventing, doing too much - or that I was trying to steal from the cultural depository of your childhood? Is this how you felt about the latest 3D animated series, made for an international audience with puzzling British accents, that also moved me?</p> <p>Or did you just not care - had it been that long?</p> <p><span class="more_info" title="But you gifted me a Snufkin cup for my birthday last year.">Ändå gav du mig en Snusmumriken-kopp i födelsedagspresent förra året.</span> Were you letting me in on the secret, your childhood, the one thing we cannot share, no matter how much I’d like to - were you welcoming me into it or just indulging me and my childish desires?</p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹 <span class="more_info" title="I don’t remember my childhood and that’s one of the few things I can say with certainty about it.">Jag minns inte mycket från min barndom, och det är en av få saker for mjag kan säga med säkerhet.</span> Another one: you weren’t there. But then again, I wasn’t either. And not just in the sense that I, the person I’ve come to be, do not and cannot live there anymore - the basic fact that the membrane of childhood doesn’t allow trespassing: «my infancy is long dead and I am alive»[^1]; but because I barely lived in that house, consumed by the business of survival, which makes ghosts of us all. My memory, the second house, made into a broken sieve, unfit for my purposes, the tasks of life.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹 Reading this again, I think: if the Internet had been as it was ten, fifteen years ago - could I have started something? Do you think that someone would’ve believed me? Troll i kulisserna could’ve been one of those stories in which Internet subculture, with its inclination towards morbidity, interacts with the loose fabric of memory, which is all the looser in childhood, remaining malleable, mobile, decades after its imprinting. I look through my notes, I look back. But I find nothing - neither proof that someone else did write about it, nor that I, for some reason, invented it.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹 Writing about myself is easy, as long as nobody sees. Writing about us is hard. I’m looking for a frame for us, a crowd for this room. Generations of queers have gathered in private places[^2], celebrating newborn tongues and attending to the wounds of the first years, when everything passes through the skin, that unfit membrane. When we met I went in headfirst because I felt that you could take it, that you wanted to - <span class="more_info" title="and I hope you felt the same">och jag hoppas att du kände likadant.</span> I felt myself falling in love with you (clearly, secretly) when, only for that once, you sat on my bed and told me of the child you were, of the story behind the scar on your left hand. I wanted to pick it up and kiss it; I don’t remember if I did. We had known each other for less than two weeks. Somewhere on your phone you have a screen recording archiving our first chats and witnessing a miraculous fact: that, in that often crude place where we met, the first pictures we sent each other were of the seas of our hometowns. There, amidst the yellow and the black, I saw the shores of Gotland and thought: I’d like to go there. Then: I think he gets it; «… <span class="more_info" title="the one pain / which is inconsolable">den smärta / som är så</span> [], the loss of one’s shore …»[^3]</p> <p><span class="more_info" title="Was it easy to receive the story of my childhood?">Var det enkelt att höra om min barndom?</span> In the beginning I wanted to tell you of the places I had escaped so that I could come to this city, where I would meet you. I wanted to put everything in sequence and see what meaning would come from it. What role you could play. Now this retroactive act is necessary to both of us, because it explains me, my resistances to you. In truth - only in telling does the pain become evident, and I can begin. Unlike Augustine, I have no God to call to, no omniscient eternal perspective to allow the retrieval of childhood under the image of eternity, the beginning act of the Western autobiography. I do not know where to begin. I need another context, an excuse - a song, a movie, a book. <span class="more_info" title="You, listening.">Du, som lyssnar.</span></p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹 I’m reading about queer memory. It’s shaping up to be a weird semester: pausing uni, trying to get therapy, writing about something new, somewhat more, somehow always less. After a few months of not approaching theory, I started reading Castiglia and Reed’s sad and exciting essay, <i>If Memory Serves</i>, on the effects of remembering and (institutional, collective) forgetting in the aftermath of AIDS. I think I need to go to the roots - of queer temporalities, of queer theories, of us, somehow, because we all exist in a world irrevocably shaped by it. <span class="more_info" title="I’m trying to learn. I’m trying to remember.">Jag försöker lära mig. Jag försöker förstå.</span></p> <p>I’ve always known that my personal memory was tattered and broken; I am starting to see that I never accessed a social, generational one as well. I have been severed not just from myself, but from an entire history of queerness - of Italian queer and trans activists (Porpora Marcasciano, Mario Mieli) who created the space in which I could’ve found rest and solace, had I dared to. But I couldn’t. The business of survival cut what remained of the thread of memory, it required me to disconnect from myself and the stories before and around me. When I walked to my high school or across the tiny streets that suddenly give way into big squares and churches in Naples, when my father drove me back home late at night, I looked away from the trans women strutting by. Was that survival again? Wasn’t that immediate fear which struck at the sight of them the beginning of this betrayal to myself, my history? This happened much later, when I wasn’t a child anymore. But I always knew where to look and, most importantly, where not to. And how can I draw a clear line between the child and the teen, when that child never died and was never really there and I live in the long aftermath of him, too?</p> <p>(I can’t say what was that severed. I can’t say yet.)</p> <p><br/></p> <p>🌹 Maybe I did invent this story about Troll i kulisserna. <p>In trying to make sense of this, I realize that what I find so fascinating about this mishap is its shift in logic. Although the removal of the Mumin masks has a practical explanation, that moment can be read also as revealing a raw materiality in the otherwise intact body of the Mumin. The consequences, which are immediately understood by children, are: their soft skin can be taken off; their fluffy bodies can be emptied out and inhabited by something different; this, of course, if it wasn’t a costume, a decoy, all along. This revelation raises a morbid question: what is a Mumin, actually? Is it an animal that can be killed and whose hide can be worn - or a strategy of prey? Who hides, then, in their big, friendly bodies? Why is Lasse Pöysti’s smile so unsettling? <span class="more_info" title="Danger in Moominvalley">Fora i Mumindalen - the safest of places</span>. Through this logic, the familiar and inconspicuous bodies of Muminpappa and Muminmamma become en hud - <span class="more_info" title="a skin - a membrane">ett membran</span>, as changeable as memory itself, the unstable resource for this story: mine, unable to find my sources anymore, and that of those children who, writing about it online, would’ve re-membered the event years after its passing, bringing that fear back to themselves; not unlike you, unable to stand the sight of Mårran.</p> <p>But the question is - if I did invent this story, fabricate it in those anguishing days of August, as I crashed at your place because my housing contract was done and I couldn’t find anything else, when our patience for each other was so thin and so much damage was done - <i>why</i> did I do that, <i>why</i> did I feel compelled to create such a horrible thing and locate it in the space of childhood? Why don’t I remember it either? Why has Troll i kulisserna ingrained itself into my mind like a secondary memory, vivid though unreal - a distant relic of a childhood that wasn’t mine, not even yours, but running alongside, sideways, to the one I had?</p> <br/> [^1]: Saint Augustine, <i>Confessions</i>, translated by Henri Chadwick, Oxford New Classics, p.7.

The space is enveloped by curtains with white and blue hues." width="50%" height="50%"/> <li>I feel that loving writing is constantly failing at the thing you love.</li> <li>The magic of us, what we can do together.</li> <li>Prague in February, when I was alone but I knew that someone was waiting for me back in Berlin, in the room where the apple tree that Steve gave me will, surprisingly, survive a whole winter, a bit of spring too. The last months before leaving home: all of its beauty and terror, the long hours of preparations, the time carved away for my friends. The last week, singing at the night with I., the hours at the bar, which advanced slowly; the month I lived with B. and I felt the pull to stay, to move in a little closer. Beginning of an October past, when F. came to visit and we walked along the same life for a little while again. The morning I’ll arrive in Paris, battered and confused, and S. will pick me up from the station and organize a huge breakfast that will go on for hours; days later, when I’ll smoke with F. on the balcony and try to explain the kind of life I’m preparing, what still scares me. What came out of the exhibition – it will be too early for this, and I will fail, again.</li> <li>The sunlit evenings of the first lockdown, when I forced myself to write every night and something came out of that, too, even if it didn’t have to. </li> <li>The night out when me and Coco rejoiced over learning that we had used the same word to describe the particular electricity of the exhibition, <i>magic</i>. Not an uncommon word, maybe not one a writer should use proudly. But I was drunk and sentimental that evening and I must protect that feeling, too: the wonder of having carved the same word to describe the same time - a tautology of magic, inspiring, confirming itself.</li> <li>Writing the first draft of this and trying (without success) to define a difference between remembering and reminiscing.</li> <li>I’ve interlaced my heart with yours. Doesn’t matter for how long. Ribbons of yours are woven in with mine. Traces; I hope you feel the same. </li> <li>Thinking a lot about memory, my hometowns. In the first year in Berlin I missed the sea the most and I tried to make the first image of my previous life out of it – gathering lines of poems, pictures real and imagined, the words of friends, too, born by the sea, to make a figure of my own. All along the sea was there, unchanged, with the after-image of me and my brother staring out into it before he left. Me, wondering when meaning would kick into place, fill in the experience. I remember the narrow, internal streets of Pozzuoli – the ample ones of Naples, opening (with a gasp) towards a sudden sky, the sea. What does missing mean? It’s only the heart adjusting. In my first months, I lied to it and let myself reminisce, promising to come back, until it didn’t matter anymore. Corners of Berlin make me cry, now. Every time I walk along Potsdamer Strasse I think of you, of us. The time me and Agata walked three or four bus stations from the Kunstraum and talked about twins and doubles of many kinds and it was sweet to have someone to speak in Italian with.</li> <li>I’ve tried to talk to each of them about the specific shape of this magic. This is what I’ve landed on: the magic was the magic. <i>You should’ve been there</i>. This magic was the magic of us. Of our time: the days of our meeting, the few months we shared, that sacred week before the opening. This magic was the magic of us, doing the thing we love. The magic was us and emanated all around from us and it came and went in waves, because pure feeling is unsustainable, but never went away. I remember blue make-up powder being put in a old salad bowl and then shared. The kitchen, our retreat, which Richie’s costumes made into a backstage, a theatre of its own. Then we went into the exhibition. </li> <li>You must develop a technique. Then you must develop another. You must have a method for summoning and you must not abuse it. You must learn how to distinguish between what must be summoned and what suffices to be recalled or imagined. Don’t call what doesn’t need to called. <i>Dream new dreams</i>. </li> <li>The magic reached its peak in two moments: when I read Tommaso’s words for the second time, after Véra instructed me on how to gather my words. Then, afterwards, when we hosted the second guided tours for strangers who would, in one day, see three or four exhibitions, who knows how many labours of love. We guided them and I felt like, for how much we tried, for how much they wanted to, they’d never be part of the magic, because it belonged to us, it emerged from these months of contact, the daily company in the week of the installation. And I felt we were like children of the same kind, strange and aslant, swimming around in a tight pack, in and out of the swarming schools of strangers, as we hyped up those for whom the time had come to explain their work (with words reasonable and intimate enough), until the moment was over, the light moved to the next piece and we reabsorbed into our group to be congratulated and held. Always a good word, always a work of love. We all hugged in front of Eze's glass trinkets, reflecting complex lights, or maybe not at all.</li> <li>When I called Mattia the last morning of the installation because nothing worked and I was ashamed of being so unprofessional and in the same room with you all he calmed me down and promised me <i>we</i>’d find a way. Mascha helped me put up the pages, stayed with me, patient and with unshakable faith in the success of our endeavour. </li> <li>The last day, before we had to leave, I went and sat down in Lu and Coco’s embryonal space. I closed my eyes, I let the sounds of water and whispers align my breath into a kinder rhythm. I made space for memory, for being there. </li> <li>I knew that something in my heart had shifted (like an old cosmic mechanism commanding the eclipse and the seasons of the moon) as I read the last words of Tommaso. I knew then that, despite my imprecisions, my rushing, my shortcomings, the slips of my pen and my mouth, despite myself, that Tommaso is alive, that he had made it through, that the ritual had been successful.</li> <li>I realized last week, getting sentimental again with Lula, that I’m not done talking about this. I don’t want to exhaust the magic, to say it all. </li> <li>Happiness is honey dripping into the heart. I move around our group like a zealot (in the blue coat Jean-Noël said made me look like a gay wizard), I want to know of everyone, I need everyone of us to know; then I step out of our swarm to see my friends, my boyfriend, to send messages to the absent and the unwilling, because I need to tell everyone that the magic was happiness and I found out that happiness gifts time back.</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">storia di tommaso (september 2023)</title><link href="https://pinetree27.github.io/blog/2024/storia-di-tommaso/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="storia di tommaso (september 2023)"/><published>2024-04-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pinetree27.github.io/blog/2024/storia%20di%20tommaso</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pinetree27.github.io/blog/2024/storia-di-tommaso/"><![CDATA[<p>Exhibition with <a href="https://www.agatahoerttrich.com/queerthingstaketime">Agata Hörttrich</a>, Coco Wiss, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ezehyon/">Ezequiel Hyon</a>, <a href="https://bueronoelle.com/">Jean-Noël Teschauer</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jilschuberth/">Jil Schuberth</a>, Lu Herbst, <a href="http://lulabornhak.com/">Lula Bornhak</a>, <a href="https://majazagorska.com/">Maja Zagórska</a>, Mascha Naumann, <a href="https://mattiafriso.com/">Mattia Friso</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/targetlady/">Richard Müller</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scek_art/">Steve C.E.

Result of the Queer Things Take Time workshop and exhibited in the omonimous exhibition in September 2023, it is a novella informed by concepts of queer temporalities. Set in the first part of the 20th century in South Tyrol, the story is told over multiple languages and perspectives of witnesses to one man’s story who, during the Italian colonisation of the land and its subsequent attack on Ethiopia, tried to define himself across the the frames and temporalities of Christianity and Italianess.</p> <p><em>First cluster: prologue / part V: the gospel of Tommaso / epilogue</em></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/blog_posts/posts/qttt-cluster1-1.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/blog_posts/posts/qttt-cluster1-1.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/blog_posts/posts/qttt-cluster1-1.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/blog_posts/posts/qttt-cluster1-1.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Introduction and conclusion to the story with words from the heart of the story, Tommaso's perspective.
