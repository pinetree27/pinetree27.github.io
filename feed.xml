Result of the Queer Things Take Time workshop and exhibited in the omonimous exhibition in September 2023, it is a novella informed by concepts of queer temporalities. Set in the first part of the 20th century in South Tyrol, the story is told over multiple languages and perspectives of witnesses to one man’s story who, during the Italian colonisation of the land and its subsequent attack on Ethiopia, tried to define himself across the the frames and temporalities of Christianity and Italianess.</p> <p><em>First cluster: prologue / part V: the gospel of Tommaso / epilogue</em></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/blog_posts/posts/qttt-cluster1-1.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/blog_posts/posts/qttt-cluster1-1.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/blog_posts/posts/qttt-cluster1-1.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/blog_posts/posts/qttt-cluster1-1.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Introduction and conclusion to the story with words from the heart of the story, Tommaso's perspective.

You wake in the middle of the night because something has broken the rhythm of your sleep: a distant howl, maybe, a call for some closeness that you too can feel, a sudden thirst.

You wish to come back to that state of youthful bliss, but it’s too late, your mind is slowly finding its way back to you. It now catches up on what your body already knew: that warmth close to you.
