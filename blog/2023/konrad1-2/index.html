Dozing off on the bus from Krumme Lanke to my room in Schlachtensee, I often found myself thinking back to the child I was - this intruder, this unknown, this obstinate dissonance in my story, a him refusing being dealt away with. I found myself stuck between this sudden necessity to remember and the scarceness of my memories, the hardness of those which had coagulated into silence, unspeakability.</p> <p>I looked for a frame for him, something to hold him into place, together. I watched Petite Fille and I found a her and then something else running alongside them, children and phantoms sharing the same game, the same running. The semester we met was quite calm; I was preparing my work. In the following, I read about queer temporalities for the first time, and found out that it had already been written about the child. While Jos√© Esteban Mu√±oz tried to redeem the future (and the value of hope and utopian feeling) from the cynicism of Leo Bersani and Lee Edelmann, the latter argued vehemently against it and, with it, the child, seen as the political vanguard of conservative, homophobic thinking. Writing at the same time as Mu√±oz, Kathrin Bond Stockton asked: how can we think about the child in a way that is neither utopic nor dismissive? And, what is a child after all?</p> <p>In order to answer that, Stockton makes a critical distinction between the child and the Child; between actual, living (‚Äòhistorical‚Äô) children and the ideological category of the Child, against which real children are confronted and understood. In doing this, she links her argument with Edelman who, in ‚ÄúNo Future‚Äù, describes the Child as a political plan enacted to secure the ‚Äòfuture‚Äô exclusively through (heterosexual-ist) reproduction. Consequently, this Child is the ideal continuation of the political ruling class: undoubtedly white, cissexual and straight, imagined as a powerless, a-sexual being in need of constant protection. Any other child - racialised, non-straight, gender-nonconforming, sexual - is not granted this security, is excluded from the category of the Child, from the white matrix, denied empathy, care, protection. As much as Edelmann argues for resistance against the Child and tries to define other worthwhile investments of queer energy, I find Stockton much more interesting, because she centers the life and experience of these real, living children; because she brings me much closer to the child which I actually was.</p> <p>(<span class="more_info" title="Did you feel safe in your childhood?">K√§nde du dig otrygg i din barndom?</span> Who protected you, and from what? I must‚Äôve been safe because I am white, mostly passed as straight. But it didn‚Äôt feel safe. It felt like walking on a line - the balancing effort took all of my energy because I was aware of the dangers that follow transpassing. I think the violence I was exposed to came from that; as if living on a string meant I had deserved it, or that no one would believe me, if I talked. <span class="more_info" title="In which ways were you allowed or not allowed to be a child?">P√• vilka s√§tt k√§nde du att du till√§ts vara ett barn?</span>)</p> <p>Stockton remarks that, even separating it from the Child, we do not come closer to understanding what a child is. A child is an ineffective definition, understood as it is exclusively in negative terms: as a non-adult, characterized by innocence (as absence of sin, in the sexual sense). Once one escapes the rigid armour of the Child, it becomes clear that this reduction does not and can not account for the complexity of the life of a child: the ¬´pleasures and terrors we recall¬ª <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, shadows of pre-sexuality, the tangled, inexplicable feelings that are too big for words, which almost place one outside of childhood. Somewhere between being a child and remembering the child, in growing up, the transmission goes wrong, and if we settle on the placating definition of ‚Äòchild‚Äô, <span class="more_info" title="a climate of suspicion, unspeakability, loss, still comes to hover over the real childhoods we had">[MISSING]</span>.</p> <p>It is hard to gauge a child‚Äôs understanding of itself, too; self-definition is obstructed by legal and social traditions that decide what a child is, what it should be, by shaping the idea of the Child. This becomes much harder for what we, backwardly, call queer children: when the vocabulary of queerness, of sexual difference, is not made available to the child (too adult, reeking too strongly of sex, of perversion), how can a child express the perceived difference between itself and its surroundings? Despite this, Stockton finds a surprising abundance of metaphors flourishing from children, lapping this very impossibility: one, for example, calling himself a ¬´gay dolphin¬ª (1); weird and aslant expressions that do their best to evade the cage of the category of Childhood. <span class="more_info" title="What did I call myself? What did you call yourself? Was ‚Äògay‚Äô attractive or painful to you?">Vad sade jag om mig sj√§lv? vad sade du om dig sj√§lv? var ‚Äúb√∂g‚Äù attraktivt eller kanske s√•rande f√∂r dig?</span>. I stayed in the safety of being unnamed as long as I could. I measure the extent of the violence also by this fact: that I already knew, always knew, that to be named is to be made visible, and to be made visible is to be put in danger. I still ask myself how could I know this. Is there an opposite to growing up - time travel? Did I, as I am and know today, somehow (impossibly) go back and explain to myself the rules of survival, so that I could be safe? Isn‚Äôt that the God Augustine calls to - the one which calls back; this conscience which is most easily explained in writing? <span class="more_info" title="Do you see what I mean? Do you see what I mean somewhat more clearly, now?">F√∂rst√•r du var jag menar? ser du vem du var tydligare √§n?</span></p> <p>Because of the hardships which she faces in trying to define what a child is, Stockton asks: is there such a thing as a child? <span class="more_info" title="And you - did you ever feel like a child? What did that mean to you?">Och du - k√§nde du dig som ett barn? Vad betydde det f√∂r dig?</span>. There is only one possible definition of the child which bears witness to this complexity: ¬´precisely who we are not and, in fact, never were¬ª (5). She concludes, dishearteningly: a child is nothing but <i>¬´the act of adults looking back¬ª</i> (5, emphasis mine). It is precisely this gesture, this defeat, this holding of complexity, which interests me, because it risks explaining what I felt. Ultimately, Stockton articulates the identity of the child by marking its distinction from the Child, distinguishing between what the child is and what it is wanted to be, what it is accepted to be, but, most importantly, <i>in and through the architecture of memory</i>.</p> <p>Confined in straightjackets of definitions, explained only through negations, every child suffers severe consequences: ¬´such a child, with no established forms to hold itself in the public, legal field, has been a child remarkably, intensely <i>unavailable to itself in the present tense¬ª</i> (6, my emphasis). A child is a being between adulthood and whatever comes before it, caught between its own perception and the invasive gaze of others: a changeling, a bortbyting. Essentially strange, queer, maybe, children exist in a middle space between life and memory, experience and recollection: its life is lived (so Stockton) between one‚Äôs own body and the category of the Child. For some of us, for myself, the body itself becomes inaccessible, and it is a life‚Äôs work to regain it. What we call a child is the result of a ¬´backward birth¬ª (6), born out of this act of looking back into the being we were and are no more, a retractive creation installed in the process of memory and recollection, between the layers of this one body which becomes double. <span class="more_info" title="Who were you, as a child? Is it still you? Were you always yourself?">[MISSING]</span>.</p> <p>I am trying to articulate, with the help of Stockton‚Äôs text, a definition of childhood as a ¬´membrane¬ª, an interstitial space, a void in-between, a mezzanine that is barely accessible to the child, but ¬´largely available to adults as memory¬ª (5). The Child imposes itself like a second skin, impossible to distinguish from the first one<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, imposing pressures and limitations, dictating what a child is, what it cannot be. A troubling degree of voyeurism haunts this definition: the child spies through the keyhole of the Child (of its body its memory) into others, into the other children and the space of living they are afforded, into the mysterious life of the adults, and into itself, its own life, body, experiences.</p> <p>As I move across my memories, to try and revive them, to make sense of what happened, as I try and access this membrane, the ¬´the pleasures and terrors¬ª woven in its fabric - the memories, real or not, of the Mumin beheading, of that vast blue silence, all of the things I can‚Äôt say yet - <span class="more_info" title="I am not returning to the child, but inventing it">[MISSING]</span>. I describe him with a vocabulary of feeling and identity that is available to me only, only in the afterwards, having reached ‚Äòadulthood‚Äô. And the child changed too, over the years - depending on the time of access, as my understanding of myself changed, as it became necessary to either install or rescue strands of emotions and thoughts that I see continuing now, in the aftermath. Said with Stockton, the child is ultimately an effect of memory, as intangible as it is, an ever-imperfect attempt to resolve the first queer autobiographical question: ¬´when did you know?¬ª (2). This matter can be hardly settled and approached only retroactively, by turning one‚Äôs gaze towards the past which couldn‚Äôt be defined in the time of its presence. Only as an adult can I look back - and this child must die, give way to me, for me to be able to call him queer. His death must be accompanied by another death: the death of what Stockton calls the ‚Äústraight child‚Äù, a manifestation of the Child structure highlighting the pressures and expectations that are supposed to catapult the child from its presumed a-sexuality into open heterosexuality. I must declare the death of the straight child for me to find the queer child - this unknown who lived desperately and proficiently in lack and in need of words, in hiding. It is only at a basic removal, at some distance - an international move, so many years of forgetting - that I might be able to reconcile myself with that child, to give it the space it needed. <span class="more_info" title="How far I‚Äôve had to go to find you">[MISSING].</span></p> <p>There is, of course, a significant degree of arbitrarity to this. How can I say with any certainty: <span class="more_info" title="_I was a queer child?_ Were you? Can anyone be?"><i>jag var queen som barn?</i> Var du? Kan man ens vara det?</span> Every language proves insufficient, every vocabulary fails. I always had, like any child, complex desires for touch, proximity, affection, and they extended both to little girls and little boys. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs enough to invoke queerness. I cannot know of my gender, too, if my sense of being non-binary today (this refusal of loud, brawling masculinity, this move towards gender expansion, questioning) can be traced back to my little games and aversions; which is to say, if I can extend my understanding of myself this far into the past. I have found hints, not one proof. I can‚Äôt say anything for certain - whether I was or wasn‚Äôt a boy, if I wanted to be; if boyhood ever meant anything to me or if it was just the hide that‚Äôd keep me the safest. <span class="more_info" title="My memories shift and spill like watercolour, and I don‚Äôt know where to begin">[MISSING]</span>. Stockton‚Äôs discourse, in her intentional, sweeping generalization of childhood as queer, pays the just tribute to the complexities of childhood; to the very real experience of conflicting feelings, statements, oblique and cross desires that (this somehow I remember so clearly) occur daily in a child‚Äôs mind, before we must learn to give it confines, before the walls are made to rise, so much taller than us.</p> <p>In this light, recollection appears as the process not just to bring memories back to oneself, but to re-inhabit the space between who one is and was, between the remembering adult and the remembered child, as well as the membrane between the child and the Child, the space of experience of the child itself, in which the feelings appeared and the memories were produced. I must declare this process impossible, too. Recollection always fails: the memories are volatile, ever-changing, prone to defect, corruption. The child remains unexplainable, inaccessible.</p> <p>I believe in this. But I know there‚Äôs degrees to the unfathomability of childhood. Maybe there are some truths about yours: memories you feel you can trust. But that‚Äôs not true for me. I have forgotten so much that was essential to who I was and the few memories which remain are the ones I cannot look at yet. All of this rests on a simple fact: I‚Äôm not sure what happened. (I was made not to be sure about what happened). I had to forget, to distance myself from the event, the memory.</p> <p>This matters not because I want to prove an essentialist sense of queerness, a timeline which from childhood leads directly into my present now - but because queerness, I believe, is a way of kinship, of connection - if I were a queer child, what (or who) can I connect that child with? What theories might I use to understand him? The result is this impossible answer - or rather, a multiplication of answers, all imperfect, all temporary, which give way into writing, into these words I try to give you.</p> <p>Sharpening a definition of ‚Äúchild‚Äù that accounts for these <i>pleasures and terrors</i> also makes space for this desire we have, as the last generation that grew between the offline and the online, when the Internet was a world still mysterious, both infinite and very small - between proto-Youtube and school courtyard tales, to find the scary and the traumatising in the medias of our childhood. I cannot claim to have taken part in any of the Mandela effects that could‚Äôve been accessible to me as an Italian kid growing up in the early 2000s, but I remember reading scary stories on Italian blogs (bad translations, but still effective), being terrorized by forcing myself to watch TV documentaries on the seven apparitions of Mary, the Mothman or reptilians; accessing the chunky Youtube of the time to watch videos about Lavender Town, being scared sleepless about its implications: dying of frequencies that only a child could hear. Years later, I would find the Troll i kulisserna/Mumintrollet story, and invest in it so deeply that I couldn‚Äôt help but write about it - the moment from which all of this started.</p> <p>(<span class="more_info" title="What does this say about me, about my childhood? Where do I go from here?">Vad s√§ger det om mig, om barndom? Det barn jag tydligen varit?</span>)</p> <p><span class="more_info" title="Terror was the easiest way I could reach myself">[MISSING]</span>; nothing brought me back to my body as efficiently as night sweats, extending my eyes into the room at night to see what I wanted to see, what I feared I would see, if only I tried hard enough, which I had to in order to protect myself; playing with turning the TV on and off, closing and opening the creepypasta blogs - fort, da. Mask on, off.</p> <p>Stockton touches only lightly on trauma in reference to Freud‚Äôs theory of Nachtr√§glichkeit, his original understanding of trauma as ‚Äúdeferred action‚Äù, an impression that is impossible for the (child) brain to process and incorporate and, as such, remains latent in the mind. This unprocessed knot of feelings and memory can be later activated during a re-exposure, when a similar event brings out the original traumatic memory, or during psychoanalysis. Only through this activation is the original traumatic event constructed, <i>retroactively</i> (nachtr√§glich), as such, and that its latent effect (protecting the psyche by avoiding situations that could‚Äôve re-ignited it) becomes seen and understandable. Like the child, trauma is created posthumously. But Stockton remarks a fundamental difference: the child can be aware of this state of deferral, of its delay; it might ¬´ await only (the right to claim) a word, not a mental state of being, withheld from them in childhood.¬ª (15).</p> <p><span class="more_info" title="As a child I was so terribly aware of myself.">Som barn var ja s√• f√∂rf√§rligt sj√§lvmedveten.</span> I tried to grow up as quickly as I could, I shifted into a space within myself where, in hiding, I would observe the adults, their mannerisms, the topics of their conversations, and tried my best to emulate them. The result of my efforts was a grotesque parody, something sombre, saddening and slightly troubling - more <i>bortbytling</i> than child. I really started to think of myself as an adult in a child‚Äôs body, because there was no space for me to hold my feelings and remain a Child. I became reckless, desperate, to grow up: I walked away with disgust from any diminutives, any -ino (which meant walking away from myself, too, as a bambino), from anything I perceived childish, from age-appropriate books; I insisted on inflating my vocabulary with big and abstruse words, and delighted when the adults, halfway buying my performance, talked to me as an adult, sometimes confided in me. Now I can‚Äôt help but see the dangers of being perceived as older. <span class="more_info" title="I don‚Äôt know if this was a consequence of the abuse or a prelude to it.">Jag vet inte om det var en konsekvens av misshandel.</span> Eventually, when the first hairs started poking out of my upper lip, I celebrated a sad victory - somehow knowing already that, though an era of powerlessness was coming to its end, becoming a boy would bring its unique and terrifying consequences, too. (How could I have known already?)</p> <p>When I look back to my memories, my point of view hangs far above my eyes, somewhere over my head. It‚Äôs always been like this and I cannot tell, now, whether this was a practical consequence of my emotional and physical dissociation, or the aftereffect of my distance as an adult which I install in the past. As if there had been some truth to my feeling of being an adult in a child‚Äôs body, I see myself as if I were walking by my side, a vaporous conscience above myself. As an image, it indicates quite nicely that it is impossible to define who I was without acknowledging where I‚Äôm throwing my gaze from now, as well as that there wouldn‚Äôt be a child without the adult to remember him. There would not be an adult without a child who, despite everything, including himself, made it through.</p> <p>Being a child, living inside of this membrane, <span class="more_info" title="at the same time inside and outside childhood">[MISSING]</span>, must‚Äôve meant living halfway there, halfway here. Never fully in one place, never able to produce a clear, uncontestable memory. This membrane, the space I retreated inside of as a child and at the same time the difference between who I am now and who I was, becomes the access point to my life - present or past. If it still makes sense to distinguish between the two. <span class="more_info" title="I lost the child, I lost memory.">Jag f√∂rlorade barnet och jag f√∂rlorade minnet.</span></p> <p>Inside the room of childhood, I listen to the sounds from the neighboring walls, observe the flickering of a flame through their semi-transparent fabric. Someone‚Äôs in the other room. These walls are the membrane - some of them hardened by the Child, obstructing communication, sight. My life is happening in the other room. I can see shadows of it, never the whole. He can see me too - how far I‚Äôve come - but not enough. I hope it‚Äôs enough to vaporize into hope for him, what we used to call destiny, or the god of broken cobblestones. The wall is a womb and a thick membrane and, through the blood, the amniotic liquid, the light sometimes shines through, and sometimes I can see him looking back at me. Most of the time the bortbytling keeps quiet, and I know he‚Äôs there just because of the way the light hits his figure, casting a terrible shadow. Some nights I find it‚Äôs myself, not him, to be wailing. In the hours before dawn, as the candleflame dies and the sun is gone, it sometimes becomes impossible to distinguish between him, who managed to survive childhood, and me who‚Äôs been survived. There‚Äôs always a wailing, always a calling - <span class="more_info" title="to make sure that, on the other side, there‚Äôs someone listening.">ett kall som s√§kerst√§ller att, p√• andra sidan, ha n√•gon som lyssnar.</span></p> <p>For both of us, desire for ¬´meaningful plenitude¬ª<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> is impossible. We wish to see what‚Äôs in the other room, what has or will happen, but we can‚Äôt. We make the best of ourselves out of the glimpses we catch, incorporating them into bigger narratives which, with time, we must shed like snakeskin. Complete vision - complete memory - is impossible. I sit in the room and listen, my ear to the wall.</p> <p>Maybe I am allowed a childhood only now that I am out of the labyrinth. The memories of what hurt are crystallised, safeguarded, and the membrane between me and them is surprisingly clear, though opaque. Awaiting, maybe, ¬´the right to claim a word¬ª I don‚Äôt know yet, or knew all along. As I look to the wall in front of me, I create the child in the other room, and the difference between imagination and memory gets thinner. He rebels, of course, and I must pay attention to do right by him. In this membrane, past and present merge into one, and I am left with this calling, the grief of this unbridgeable distance, and the vague shape of a future project on a wall I haven‚Äôt turned to in so long.</p> <p>üåπ We talk about this. I convince you. We spend a long afternoon, then a long evening, trying to translate all of this into your mother tongue, rushed by a deadline I wasn‚Äôt careful enough to anticipate. I sit on the sofa, you at the desk, working away. Sometimes you ask me what I mean with this or that. I try to tell you, but the afternoon‚Äôs fight still reverberates across my ability to explain myself. I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore.</p> <p>Every other time that we talked about this - me writing about my childhood, about us - you sounded excited. I was happy to see you involved, interested in my work. But this is not what I wanted. You resent me for this.</p> <p>It will take me a long time - even after Gotland - to realize that I had messed up my expectations, the workload. All of this because I couldn‚Äôt say this: will you please look at this I wrote? It‚Äôs for you. It‚Äôs about you. I want you to be part of it, too. I want our names to exist together, next to one another, on a page.</p> <p>üåπ We fought once and, in the crying and reconciling that comes afterwards, you were pointedly honest and said something that I didn‚Äôt think would‚Äôve hurt me. Then, to my surprise, I found a breathlessness rising in my chest and I observed myself as I ran to the bathroom, locked myself in there. In the memory, the camera follows me from above, like some kind of action scene, or a nature documentary. <span class="more_info" title="You ran after me and waited outside, terrified.">Du sprang efter mig och v√§ntade utanf√∂r, f√∂rskr√§ckt.</span> Inside, I dealt with the first panic attack of my life. In the mist-like texture of memory, which is also my life, the words you had said on the sofa mixed themselves curiously with my mother‚Äôs voice, even though I can‚Äôt ever remember her saying anything similar to what you did, my body reacted to it nonetheless. When I got out, you apologized. I was delighted. The panic your words caused in me proved two things: first, that our relationship had alchemized that unique chemistry of safety and challenge, allowing us to keep moving; secondly, the existence of something true inside of myself, a feeling of hurt so deep and unquestionable that it had to mobilize my whole body to work through it. It proved that I had actually been hurt - that the memories were not wrong; <span class="more_info" title="that they could be awakened - by you.">att dom kunde v√§ckas till liv - av dig.</span></p> <p>üåπ I had never really looked at that picture. This is the only picture of my childhoodI still have on my computer. I was playing a little violet plastic piano, he a silver saxophone, also plastic. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm smiling, smirking, or looking a little terrified at the camera. It changes everytime I look.</p> <p>We are standing in front of our desk. We are right in front of the one that, years later, would become mine. We never changed them. I just remembered I used to hide in there. I would put my face against the little space between the desk and the wall, where a little cold air would come through, and breathe really slowly. So as to no make a sound.</p> <p>I cry for a few seconds, then it‚Äôs over again.</p> <p>üåπ It gets better. We forget the incident. The excitement of being done with it also helps. I receive your impressions of the project, I archive them inside of them. I share a few of mine, trying not to hurt either of us. But we did it. We didn‚Äôt give up on this. We land on something different than what I had imagined - something which, over time, I will begin to recognise as ours.</p> <p>üåπ As I was researching this text, I began reading more about Tove Jansson. I found out that, as per the custom of the time, she referred to lesbians (and herself) as ‚Äúghosts‚Äù.</p> <p>üåπ We didn‚Äôt watch All of Us Strangers (Haigh, 2023) together. I needed a space of feelings encumbered by anyone else‚Äôs presence, by their feelings, their reaction to mine. (I went with Eesha, but we agreed to sit at opposite sides of the movie hall and reconvene later.) It‚Äôs also true that I‚Äôm not very good at letting you in. When we talked about it, later, I tried to tell you about what I had seen, but I failed. <span class="more_info" title="But this is me trying.">Men det h√§r √§r jag som f√∂rs√∂ker.</span></p> <p>One of the most striking moments happens when, halfway across the movie, Adam stays the night in the impossible house of his parents. As he wakes up from troubled sleep, he‚Äôs wearing the pajama of his childhood self, strained painfully, comically, over his adult body, like a costume. As with Stockton‚Äôs membrane, Adam accesses his childhood by re-inhabiting the skin (clothes) of the child he was, making memory physical, a space that can be embodied, allowing him access to the his childhood in an unprecedented way. These are the last moments of Adam‚Äôs journey into the past, as the membrane becomes the thinnest, the most dangerous. When he, unable to sleep, slips into his parent‚Äôs bedroom and has a nighttime conversation with his mother, he finds out that, in this trespassing of the barrier between adult and child, all of his terror and grief which inhabited his childhood have made it through, too. Like a child, he‚Äôs looking for reassurance: Like Stockton‚Äôs child and Freud‚Äôs Nachtr√§glichkeit, the past must be reactivated in order to be made available, to be processed. In the beginning of the movie, Adam lives a monotonous and safe life, until a chance encounter with someone he‚Äôd like to love acts as a catalyst for the mechanism of memory. Only after Harry, because of him, does the membrane between childhood and adult self become available and Adam gets to meet his parents, who died in a car accident when he was little. Only after knowing them as an adult, and letting himself be known (coming out, too), does the continuation of the story, and love, become possible.</p> <p>After the night in his parent‚Äôs house Adam wakes up in his own bed and finds shelter from his night terror in Harry. As he stands up, Adam opens up for the first time and tells him of the grief of losing his parents, the uncomfortableness of growing up in the aftermath of HIV, moving to the big city, losing friends, finding himself stuck in a life without much joy but also without pain. All of this, he admits, mixed to become the same feeling: ¬´ I felt like the future didn‚Äôt matter ¬ª.</p> <p><span class="more_info" title="Our disagreement over the movie lay in the fact that you read it as a ghost story and a tragedy and I couldn‚Äôt">V√•r oenighet √∂ver filmen ligger i faktumet om att du ser den som en tragedi.</span></p> <p>Adam has one last lunch with his parents and, this time, gets to say goodbye to them. Afterwards, instead of going to his apartment and waiting for Harry to come up, he heads to his place for the first time. As he opens the doror, he finds his friend‚Äôs body, rotting. Harry enters the room and Adam tries to convince him to go out, but he insists on staying, admitting, in between tears, that he can smell his own body. He must‚Äôve killed himself months before, when, after their first meeting, Adam (still crystallized in his loneliness and grief) rejected him. But he eventually manages to convince him and, in the last scene, Adam hugs Harry in his own bed, as the camera pans away from them, until nothing but darkness and one bright star appear. You saw that as the last moment of happiness granted to them. But I don‚Äôt think so. When Adam carries Harry into his room, he‚Äôs not just accompanying him towards the light. In the scene before, as they find Harry‚Äôs body, it can be identified because it is wearing the same clothes he was wearing during that first encounter - the same salmon sweater that Harry wears when he enters the room, carrying the same bottle of gin that he offered Adam at his doorstep, before he rejected him. In Harry‚Äôs room, the past of his death coexists with a present in which he is still alive.</p> <p>I believe that, as Adam went back to touch the membrane of his childhood, he became able to break the one that separates the past from the present, too. As he intervenes to stop Harry from touching his own body, as he hugs him to sleep, <span class="more_info" title="he‚Äôs not accepting his death: he‚Äôs re-writing history, he‚Äôs changing the past.">en g√•va, ledandes in i en ny framtid, som gjordes m√∂jlig genom att √§ndra det f√∂rflutna.</span> His engagement with the past has awakened the dead, yes, but also made other configurations of the present possible; coming from an alternative future in which he did have a relationship with Harry, he visits the past of that first night and is able to intervene in it, to save Harry, to establish a new time.</p> <p>This is what I wanted to tell you. I don‚Äôt want us to be ghosts. I want happiness for us now.</p> <p>I‚Äôm trying to learn how to read hope, baby.</p> <p>üåπ What else I can say about my childhood:</p> <p>As a child I was not safe. None of us were. I was aware of this and aware that it was wrong to feel like this. Because my heartbreak and my grief and my anger could not be held anywhere, because I was required to live in unsafe conditions without the power to change them, I created an ever-growing distance between myself, my body and feelings. To feel in charge, to regain some sense of control, I played with the balance between safety and danger, with horror, scaring myself and others. So much of what happened, of what I was set to become, was outside of my control. The mask was taken off even when I asked it to stop. I had to watch it happen all throughout my childhood. One moment you‚Äôre safe, the next you‚Äôre not. This child is alive in me and he sometimes screams at you for what you ask of me, for what you don‚Äôt give, for what I don‚Äôt know how to ask.</p> <p>But I also know something else. <span class="more_info" title="I‚Äôm trying to tell you that there was a kernel of you in my childhood.">Jag f√∂rs√∂ker ber√§tta f√∂r dig att det fanns en k√§rna av dig i min barndom.</span> I‚Äôve been trying to gather the pieces, to write it all together, and I wanted you to have a part, too. Because if my memory remains shadowy, exposed to stronger winds that bend it and shape it beyond my will, if the whole category of childhood couldn‚Äôt sustain me, couldn‚Äôt keep me safe, then maybe I was never a child, if anyone can be. Maybe I‚Äôm just learning now how to be one. Maybe you‚Äôre teaching me.</p> <p>If whatever child I can call to is a construction, if I cannot penetrate the membrane anyhow, if I am doomed to living with the ghost of him, then maybe I can see that he‚Äôs still here, and I did save him, I did save us; andif my memory is intangible and changeable, if both queerness and the absence of it are inventions, if I cannot write what happened without being so fucking afraid that someone would dismiss it, challenge it, counter it ‚Äì if there are no facts now that I can appeal to, if there wasn‚Äôt anyone ever to help me, then I was never inside of the reality of the Child. Maybe, then, I can take that skin off and write a different story, call it autobiography. In it, zapping through afterhours Italian TV channels, I did stumble upon a Mumin cartoon ‚Äì upon Tofslan och Vifslan, lovers or twins, and the Groke, who didn‚Äôt frighten me. Maybe my father did go to Sweden, and he brought something sweet and intangible, a handful of perfect snow, which I picked up from the nightstand before I left. If I have no recollections I can serve myself with, then I can take the leap and call my writing my memory.</p> <p>If there was a time in which the two of us were kids at the same time, I can record this simple chronological fact in sequence and make it aslant by adding <i>tilsammans</i>. The story, impossible to prove, goes: on one afternoon of primary school the child you were, your left hand still unscarred, took the hand of the child I was in the courtyard, and the affection we discovered in that September of two years ago has not been invented, it rather moved across history from that one afternoon towards this time and space, to meet the people we are, who have forgotten, and illuminate childhood with its possibility.</p> <p>Because if you were there, in my childhood ‚Äì then it becomes easier for me to believe that there was goodness there, too, and kindness and understanding and love, and that the punishment for my trespasses didn‚Äôt ruin me; I then remember that I wasn‚Äôt alone, I never was, and that there was play too, and fun, because despite my malaise, my terminal seriousness, we play sometimes and it‚Äôs nice, it‚Äôs just fucking nice, and sometimes we play this game called ‚Äòfantasy of a house‚Äô where I tell you why I sometimes lash out at you and you tell me why you can‚Äôt believe my good faith ‚Äì the missing page, that which will not be written.</p> <p>Eventually we go to bed. Turning the light off, you ask me to hug you and I do, just before you fall asleep, you before me always. With my head full of the work of the day (the dissatisfaction with the way words flow, the rare moments where it becomes easy), I see clearly that, in this little bed, we are moving back in time as well as onwards, while being perfectly grounded in the present, like a sturdy island in a storm; then, for the first time in my life, the future opens up like the sea, infinite and safe, seen from <span class="more_info" title="this happy room we write together.">i detta lyckliga rum vi skrev tilsammans.</span></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>Kathryn Bond Stockton, The Queer Child, or Growing Sideways in the Twentieth Century, Duke University Press, 2009, page 6.¬†<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>TThis connection between temporal regimes (as the Child, ultimately, is a way to control that phase of human growth) and somatic experience brings me back to an insight of Elizabeth Freeman, who, in ‚ÄúTime Binds‚Äù, described the chrononormative nature of capitalistic, heterosexualist time as a ¬´somatic fact¬ª, that is to say, the way that thisis made to appear natural because of its inscription into the body and its rhythms/cycles.¬†<a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>The quote is from Samyel Delaney‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Motion of Light in Water‚Äù, Arbor House, 1998, quoted in Jos√© Esteban Mu√±oz, Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity, NYU Press, 2019, page 59.
