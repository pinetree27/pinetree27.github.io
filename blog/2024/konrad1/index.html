The play, the second official Mumin theatre adaptation written by Tove Jansson and directed by Vivica Bandler, is known today mostly because of its beginning, in which the Mumin actors enter the stage with usual, intact costumes to then remove their fluffy heads – unmasking, amongst others, the perfectly childish smirk of Lasse Pöysti, playing Moomintrollet. This was ostensibly done to give the actors more freedom with voice and facial expressions, but a dark-internet myth has gathered around the play: children in the audience terrorized by this quasi Mumin decapitation, revealing horribly out-of-place humans inside their white, rotund bodies. With the following performances and the TV broadcast the incident was repeated, making the play into a uniting traumatic memory for generations of Swedish children.</i></p> <p> When I started writing this in May, I wanted to talk about childhood – mine and yours, or rather, the projection of mine on yours, because you don’t like talking about the past and I try to respect that. In the following months, with the following rewrites, I set out to find more information on this play. I was hoping to see the taking-off of the masks – to hear, if not see, the children’s reaction – but I haven’t been able to find any clips of it. In the (unofficial) Mumin wiki, which my research history states I consulted, this ‘decapitation’ is mentioned without any horrific undernotes. Were children really scared? Where did I get the idea that they were? While the absence of proof solidifies the status of the event as a myth, there must’ve been another source, expanding on the story to prove, once more, the Internet’s strange passion for finding the grotesque, the uncanny, the not-quite-right, the traumatising in children’s stories. And that I hadn’t just invented it. </p> <p> You have, of course, no memory of Troll I kulisserna. You were born too late; the Mumin stories you grew up with were different, safe, an uncomplicated background: there, but never essential. <span class="more_info" title="But were there other stories of horror that captured you, when you were young?">Med fanns det någon annan marginell skräck från sagor som fängslade dig när du var liten?</span> You became uneasy when, during one of my marathons, I showed you the ’70 Mumin episode in which Mårran appears for the first time. After asking me to press stop, you told me of how deeply unsettling it was, as a child, to see her towering over Sniff; mysterious, cold, silent. A creature one couldn’t make sense of, couldn’t speak to. Did you have to distinguish, then, between what your eyes just saw and the child’s memory, enlarged, made stranger against the backdrop of your mind?</p> <p> Whether I came up with it or someone else, the question is: what feelings, fake or real, were activated and subsumed into the memory of the Mumin beheading as it was passed on, shared, confused, installed in the precarious architecture of recollection - which <span class="more_info" title="pleasures and terrors">«njutningar och fasor»</span>, otherwise unspeakable, found their expression in it?</p> <p><br> 🌹 I was gifted the complete edition <span class="more_info" title="in translation">(iöversatt)</span> of the original Tove Jansson Mumin strips for my eighteenth birthday, long before I met you. I was only a little into them, mostly fascinated by Snufkin, but it was the gift of a friend trying to share her passion for them with me. When I told you, did you feel that I was being ungenuine, maybe inventing, doing too much - or that I was trying to steal from the cultural depository of your childhood? Is this how you felt about the latest 3D animated series, made for an international audience with puzzling British accents, that also moved me?</p> <p>Or did you just not care - had it been that long?</p> <p><span class="more_info" title="But you gifted me a Snufkin cup for my birthday last year.">Ändå gav du mig en Snusmumriken-kopp i födelsedagspresent förra året.</span> Were you letting me in on the secret, your childhood, the one thing we cannot share, no matter how much I’d like to - were you welcoming me into it or just indulging me and my childish desires? <br> 🌹 <span class="more_info" title="I don’t remember my childhood and that’s one of the few things I can say with certainty about it.">Jag minns inte mycket från min barndom, och det är en av få saker for mjag kan säga med säkerhet.</span> Another one: you weren’t there. But then again, I wasn’t either. And not just in the sense that I, the person I’ve come to be, do not and cannot live there anymore - the basic fact that the membrane of childhood doesn’t allow trespassing: «my infancy is long dead and I am alive»<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>; but because I barely lived in that house, consumed by the business of survival, which makes ghosts of us all. My memory, the second house, made into a broken sieve, unfit for my purposes, the tasks of life. <br> 🌹 Reading this again, I think: if the Internet had been as it was ten, fifteen years ago - could I have started something? Do you think that someone would’ve believed me? Troll i kulisserna could’ve been one of those stories in which Internet subculture, with its inclination towards morbidity, interacts with the loose fabric of memory, which is all the looser in childhood, remaining malleable, mobile, decades after its imprinting. I look through my notes, I look back. But I find nothing - neither proof that someone else did write about it, nor that I, for some reason, invented it. <br> 🌹 Writing about myself is easy, as long as nobody sees. Writing about us is hard. I’m looking for a frame for us, a crowd for this room. Generations of queers have gathered in private places<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, celebrating newborn tongues and attending to the wounds of the first years, when everything passes through the skin, that unfit membrane. When we met I went in headfirst because I felt that you could take it, that you wanted to - <span class="more_info" title="and I hope you felt the same">och jag hoppas att du kände likadant.</span> I felt myself falling in love with you (clearly, secretly) when, only for that once, you sat on my bed and told me of the child you were, of the story behind the scar on your left hand. I wanted to pick it up and kiss it; I don’t remember if I did. We had known each other for less than two weeks. Somewhere on your phone you have a screen recording archiving our first chats and witnessing a miraculous fact: that, in that often crude place where we met, the first pictures we sent each other were of the seas of our hometowns. There, amidst the yellow and the black, I saw the shores of Gotland and thought: I’d like to go there. Then: I think he gets it; «… <span class="more_info" title="the one pain / which is inconsolable">den smärta / som är så</span> [], the loss of one’s shore …»<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p> <p><span class="more_info" title="Was it easy to receive the story of my childhood?">Var det enkelt att höra om min barndom?</span> In the beginning I wanted to tell you of the places I had escaped so that I could come to this city, where I would meet you. I wanted to put everything in sequence and see what meaning would come from it. What role you could play. Now this retroactive act is necessary to both of us, because it explains me, my resistances to you. In truth - only in telling does the pain become evident, and I can begin. Unlike Augustine, I have no God to call to, no omniscient eternal perspective to allow the retrieval of childhood under the image of eternity, the beginning act of the Western autobiography. I do not know where to begin. I need another context, an excuse - a song, a movie, a book. <span class="more_info" title="You, listening.">Du, som lyssnar.</span> <br> 🌹 I’m reading about queer memory. It’s shaping up to be a weird semester: pausing uni, trying to get therapy, writing about something new, somewhat more, somehow always less. After a few months of not approaching theory, I started reading Castiglia and Reed’s sad and exciting essay, <i>If Memory Serves</i>, on the effects of remembering and (institutional, collective) forgetting in the aftermath of AIDS. I think I need to go to the roots - of queer temporalities, of queer theories, of us, somehow, because we all exist in a world irrevocably shaped by it. <span class="more_info" title="I’m trying to learn. I’m trying to remember.">Jag försöker lära mig. Jag försöker förstå.</span></p> <p>I’ve always known that my personal memory was tattered and broken; I am starting to see that I never accessed a social, generational one as well. I have been severed not just from myself, but from an entire history of queerness - of Italian queer and trans activists (Porpora Marcasciano, Mario Mieli) who created the space in which I could’ve found rest and solace, had I dared to. But I couldn’t. The business of survival cut what remained of the thread of memory, it required me to disconnect from myself and the stories before and around me. When I walked to my high school or across the tiny streets that suddenly give way into big squares and churches in Naples, when my father drove me back home late at night, I looked away from the trans women strutting by. Was that survival again? Wasn’t that immediate fear which struck at the sight of them the beginning of this betrayal to myself, my history? This happened much later, when I wasn’t a child anymore. But I always knew where to look and, most importantly, where not to. And how can I draw a clear line between the child and the teen, when that child never died and was never really there and I live in the long aftermath of him, too?</p> <p>(I can’t say what was that severed. I can’t say yet.) <br> 🌹 Maybe I did invent this story about Troll i kulisserna.</p> <p>In trying to make sense of this, I realize that what I find so fascinating about this mishap is its shift in logic. Although the removal of the Mumin masks has a practical explanation, that moment can be read also as revealing a raw materiality in the otherwise intact body of the Mumin. The consequences, which are immediately understood by children, are: their soft skin can be taken off; their fluffy bodies can be emptied out and inhabited by something different; this, of course, if it wasn’t a costume, a decoy, all along. This revelation raises a morbid question: what is a Mumin, actually? Is it an animal that can be killed and whose hide can be worn - or a strategy of prey? Who hides, then, in their big, friendly bodies? Why is Lasse Pöysti’s smile so unsettling? <span class="more_info" title="Danger in Moominvalley">Fora i Mumindalen - the safest of places</span>. Through this logic, the familiar and inconspicuous bodies of Muminpappa and Muminmamma become en hud - <span class="more_info" title="a skin - a membrane">ett membran</span>, as changeable as memory itself, the unstable resource for this story: mine, unable to find my sources anymore, and that of those children who, writing about it online, would’ve re-membered the event years after its passing, bringing that fear back to themselves; not unlike you, unable to stand the sight of Mårran.</p> <p>But the question is - if I did invent this story, fabricate it in those anguishing days of August, as I crashed at your place because my housing contract was done and I couldn’t find anything else, when our patience for each other was so thin and so much damage was done - <i>why</i> did I do that, <i>why</i> did I feel compelled to create such a horrible thing and locate it in the space of childhood? Why don’t I remember it either? Why has Troll i kulisserna ingrained itself into my mind like a secondary memory, vivid though unreal - a distant relic of a childhood that wasn’t mine, not even yours, but running alongside, sideways, to the one I had? <br></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>Saint Augustine, <i>Confessions</i>, translated by Henri Chadwick, Oxford New Classics, p.7. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>Think of the jazz club in <i>Looking for Langtson</i> (Julien, 1989) where erotic and playful encounters between men happen.
