The second Mumin play, written by Tove Jannson and directed by Vivica Bandler, has gained a small but lasting fame because of the scene in which the Mumin actors enter the stage with intact, immediately recognisable costumes, to then take off their huge, fluffy heads. This was ostensibly done to give the actors more playroom with voice and facial expressions throughout the play, but a dark-internet myth gathered around the play: children terrorized by this decapitation of the Mumins, revealing humans, horribly out of place inside their white round bodies. This symbolic collective suicide became - so goes the story - a repeated traumatic incident, as the play was repeated, broadcasted on TV, then a cultural traumatic memory, uniting generations of Swedish children. </p> </body> </html>
