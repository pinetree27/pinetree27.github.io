I'm a writer and student based in Berlin. I completed a BA in Modern Literatures in Naples and I'm working on an MA in Comparative Literatures at Freie Universit√§t. My academic interests are in critical temporality theory, autotheory and queer temporalities. I write mostly about queer pockets of time, genderbending Rilke, pilgrimages and the uncanny resemblance of St. Wilgefortis to Jesus Christ. I am the Turmgesellschaft's sworn enemy. I use they/them pronouns in English, sie/ihm in German. Feel free to contact me at marialauridslazzarotti [at] tutanota.de.
